Finding Periodic Outliers over a Monogenetic Event Stream Kimio Kuramitsu Yokohama National University 79\2051 i ku Yokohama 240\2058501 JAPAN kkuramitsu@acm.org Abstract Sensors are active everywhere Enormous volumes of sensed events are sent over the data streams while most of applications want to focus on events that would be curious We propose a technique for mining periodicities and predicting its outliers from the stream The key to our technique is a simple periodic pattern 001 t derived from delta-time mining or SUP  t t 001 t  We provide e\001cient algorithms for 223nding the highest support 001 t on a small and resource-limited sensor device Our experiments will compare memory e\001ciency and accuracy on a variety of event patterns monogenesis polygenesis and semi-random 1 Introduction Lots of sensors are increasingly active in the ubiquitous computing environment Events sensed are sent over the data stream and result in massive volumes in the n side The developer of sensor applications dislikes monitoring all the events Instead they are interested in events that might be curious to be deal with We focus our attention on periodic outliers over the sensed events Most of events occur with some periodicities and then we feel unusual if the occurrence doesn\220t follow periodicities that we expect For example there is a well-known scenario so-called 216morning co\002ee\216 Suppose the readers have an old parent who makes co\002ee every morning If he or she didn\220t make co\002ee this morning the readers would be very anxious because it is unusual A regular report that the co\002eemaker sends every morning is boring while an unusual report is crucial to make smart responses in the application A straightforward approach is that the user sets some rules like 216 report me if the co\002eemaker doesn\220t work between 6:00AM and 8:00AM 216 However it is hard to e, 0500 e, 0600 e, 0800 e, 0830 e, 0900 e, 0500 e, 0600 event, 0800 e should be NOT HERE event, 0900 e should be HERE   Ordinary Sensor Smart Sensor  Annotation Figure 1 Smart Sensor specify all rules because the user does not necessary know all unusual situations In addition the handspeci\223ed rules are in\224exible when the environment is  We consider a smart sensor  which learns periodicities from the latest event pattern and automatically noti\223es unusual events annotated with attentions over the stream Figure 1 The annotation helps the developer promptly understand whether or not the events are supposed to be interesting We address the problem of 223nding the periodicities and its outliers over the event sensor The objective of this per is to present an l lgorithm to maintain the statistics of events in a limited computing resource Note that computing resources in sensor devices 5 a r e s t ill limit e d  w h i c h imp o s e s p e c i a l constraints on the algorithm We make the following contributions 200 We apply an inter-transaction mining to 223nd periodicities over the stream data 200 We simplify our periodic pattern to predict outliers in a real-time manner 200 We develop an incremental algorithm that works on a ze sliding window and Proceedings of the 2005 International Works hop on Ubiquitous Data Management \(UDM\22205 0-7695-2411-7/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


200 We show performance studies and the accuracy of predicted outliers using synthetic datasets This paper addresses the problem of 223nding periodic outliers over the sensor device The rest of the paper proceeds as follows In Section 2 we model the data model and periodic patterns In Section 3 we describe an inter-transaction mining approach to the problem In Section 4 we develop an incremental algorithm of 223nd the dominant period over the sliding window In Section 5 we review related work In Section 6 we conclude the paper 2 Event quence and Periodicities Not a few researchers have attempted to 223nd periodicities rom sensor data Most of attempts are based on the DSP techniques such as frequency transformation e.g FFT DCT and DWT On the contrary we are attempting to 223nd an association rule between event times  We ignore an association rule between events since we assume that the periodicity of events is monogenetic 2.1 Event Sequence A sensor is a small device that reads a series of events whenever the events happen The kind of the events is identi\223ed by a set E   e 1 e 2   e i   We write 001 e t 002 to represent an event e occurring at t the time of the occurrence Hereafter we call 001 e t 002 an event for short We do not consider the amount of events in this paper rdingly a r can read 001 e 1 t 1 002  001 e 3 t 2 002  001 e 1 t 3 002  001 e 2 t 3 002  001 e 2 t 4 002  Note that we suppose t i t j if i<j in this paper In addition the events are assumed to be sensed irregularly i.e t i 212 t i 212 1 is t constant We look at the nature f events In l the occurrence of events is correlated some events cause other kinds of events If we aggregated much more kinds of events from a variety of sensors we should know more cause-and-e\002ect relationship between different events However we are in this paper interested in a single sensor device which may read a single kind of events Accordingly we concentrate on a single kind of events nti\223ed by e  De\223nition 2.1 event sequence An event sequence S is a set of events that 001 e t 1 002  001 e t 2 002  001 e t 3 002  001 e t n 212 1 002  001 e t n 002   S time events Figure 2 A Pictorial Notation of A Event Sequence S S Monogenesis S Polygenesis randomly Figure 3 Monogenesis vs lygenesis 200 contains only event e  200 is totally ordered by t and 200 is semi-\223nite  n is growing Figure 2 is a l n f S that we use throughout this paper For convenience we view that S is 223nite   S   n t t n and t n is used to represent the latest time in the sequence The problem that we address is to guess whether an new event 001 e t n 1 002 is unusual from a given S  It is important to note that we don\220t consider the correlation between di\002erent events  e and e 001  Our result uld be easier to te with other tionbased results 2.2 Periodic Pattern We would like to begin th a basic on what causes events We can observe some periodic changes in the natural rld e.g earth tion and orbital motion are an important trigger to cause other events me social periods such as week or quarter are rti\223cial but they originated in the natural periodicity We assume that there exist some external periodic changes or periodic factors  which have much in\224uence on the sequence of sensor events Our sensor is limited and impossible to directly observe external changes but we can infer the period of the hidden factor from sensed patterns Assuming that external factors are absolute sensor events that do not follow them canberegardedas outliers  Next question is how many factors in\224uence the occurrence of events We assume that there are two types of the source monogenesis and polygenesis  Proceedings of the 2005 International Works hop on Ubiquitous Data Management \(UDM\22205 0-7695-2411-7/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


200 monogenesis  All events in S are descended from a single periodic factor For example suppose that we drink co\002ee every day except for weekends In this case drinking co\002ee is not daily but weekly 200 polygenesis Eventsin S occur in a form of multiple factors sometimes including random s For example suppose that we drink co\002ee regularly in the morning while we drink randomly in the afternoon due to unexpected visitors To 223nd outliers we highlight monogenesis chie\224y for two reasons One reason is that monogenesis is easier to treat than polygenesis The simplicity is the primary concern in a small sensor device Another reason is that a polygenetic sequence might result from the sensor incapability or the lack of information on events In the above example morning co\002ee and afternoon co\002ee should be regarded as di\002erent events such as break and visitor We consider that the core problem lies in handling a monogenetic sequence Note that in order to enhance the sensor capability we are attempting to extract monogenetic sequences from arbitrary sequences Our earlier attempt was reported in 6 2.3 Monogenetic Period We view that all sequences uld be monogenetic This means that one important period dominates the whole nce We use 001 t to denote such a period More formally we de\223ne the period over the sequence as follows De\223nition 2.2 period An event 001 e t 002 satis\223es the period 001 t if and only if there exists 001 e t 212 001 t 002 in S  It is important to note that not all event sequences have the dominant period If S is given randomly we cannot 223nd any periodicities in S  It is impossible to apply our assumption to all sequences but if the sequence has periodicity a little our assumption works to 223nd 3 A Data-Mining Approach We need to 223nd the dominant period of a given sequence S  even if it is not necessarily pure monogenic A key is to measure how dominant possible candidates in S are To measure we use an idea of the support introduced in the data mining literature For readability we assume in this section that S is a 223nite sequence that has n events and all nts in S are stored in a disk A semi-\223nite version on the data stream will be shown in the next section 3.1 Candidate Generation We start by generating the candidate set of the dominant period from S  For nce we use 001t instead of 001 for the candidate periods The candidate set of S is denoted C  S   001t 1 001t 2   001t i    Following is a very simple algorithm to 223nd all candidates in S  for  i 1 i<n  i   for  j  i 1 j  n  j   001t  t j 212 t i  add  C  S  001t    We denote m to represent the number of C  S  or  C  S    The above would te O  n 2  candidates in the worst case although almost all of candidates are useless The pruning of hopeless candidatures will be described in the context of our stream processing 3.2 Finding Dominant Period The period 001 t of S is one of the elements in C  S  Here we consider S  001t  t o b e a s ubs e t o f S that ntains all events satisfying 001t by De\223nition 2.2 for  i 1 i<n  i   if  001 e t i  001t 002  exists in S  add  S  001t   001 e t i 002   Let  S  and  S  001t   denote the number of events in S and S  001t   resp ect i v el y  N o w  w e ca n s a y S supports 001t with  S  001t    S   We write SUP  001t  1 for the support of S  001t  T h e period 001 t of S can be chosen from C  S  such that SUP 001 t  is maximal for all SUP  001t n C  S  gure 4 illustrate how to choose 001 t from a given sequence For simplicity we assume that all candidate periods are multiple of 001 1 Since the period 001 4getsthe highest rate we regard 001 t  001 4 te that we only count valid events in the table h it is ignorable if  S  is much huger We say S is monogenetic if S supports 001 t with nearly 100 Noise partially random sequences or outliers lower the support It is di\003cult to say the lower bound of useful SUP 001 t  because the threshold varies from application to application 1 A shorthand of SUP  t 002 t  001t  Proceedings of the 2005 International Works hop on Ubiquitous Data Management \(UDM\22205 0-7695-2411-7/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
