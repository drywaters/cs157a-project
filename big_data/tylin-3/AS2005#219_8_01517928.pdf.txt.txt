More and more learning contents have been published and shared over the Internet. Therefore, how to progress an efficient learning process becomes a critical issue. This paper proposes a sequential mining algorithm to analyze learning behaviors for discovering frequent sequential patterns. By these patterns, we can provide suggestions for learners to select their interest learning contents. Different to other sequential mining algorithms, this study provides an incrementally method to analyze learning sequencing. More specifically, the mining algorithm in this paper can provide real-time analysis, and then report to learners for selecting learning contents more easily Keywords: e-learning, data mining, sequential mining, frequent pattern, real-time analysis 1. Introduction The association problem first proposed at 1993 by Agrawal et al. [1]. The most important problem of data mining is to mine the frequent patterns and generate association rules [2][7]. Following previous research Agrawal and Srikant [8] describe how to extract sequential patterns from continuous transaction data and they propose three algorithms AprioriAll AprioriSome, and DynamicSome to verify their opinion. Besides, in 1996, Agrawal and Srikant [6 generalize their earlier problem definitions and present GSP algorithm to discover generalized sequential patterns. For the generalized problem definitions Agrawal and Srikant add time constraints to specify the minimum and/or maximum time period between adjacent patterns. Accordingly, we use time period constraint to split the continuous learning behavior and use similar idea to define our learning sequence Recently, web mining becomes an important issue which uses sequential mining techniques to discover the browsing behavior patterns over Internet [5 According to web mining technique, some recommended system and intelligent learning platform were developed [3]. This paper proposes the algorithm for real-time learning behavior mining, and we modify some characteristics to fit in with learning activities Besides, the patterns that we recognize are different with traditional sequential patterns, and our patterns are emphasizing the strong orderly relationship between learning sequences. For each recognized association rule, the present form shows a relationship between two learning sequences, ex. &lt; A, B &gt; ? &lt; C D &gt; [sup. = 10%, conf. = 50%] means least 10% of all 


D &gt; [sup. = 10%, conf. = 50%] means least 10% of all sequences, which shows &lt; A, B &gt; and &lt; C, D &gt; occur continuous and together. Furthermore, it also indicates when &lt; A, B &gt; appears then in 50% cases &lt; C, D &gt also appears successively The rest of this article is organized as follows Section 2 introduces the core idea of our real-time mining model. Section 3 defines some notations and definitions in this mining algorithm. Following the definitions, section 4 depicts the algorithms, and then provides adjusting methods for controlling the database. Finally, section 5 draws conclusions 2. Learning Pattern Mining questionable set conjectural set believable set  min_sup - ? min_sup new sequence feedback preprocessing sequences in database Figure 1. Diagram of sequences state transfer Figure 1 shows that the sequence database is composed of questionable, conjectural and believable sets. Following that, the mining algorithm decomposes the input sequence to several subsequences and records Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence \(WI  05 0-7695-2415-X/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE them into the three sets. For each sequence in the sequence database, it has a count of occurrence value which is the support count of the sequence. Generally speaking, sequences in believable set which are satisfying minimum support threshold are useful for discovering learning patterns. Questionable set contains the sequences that do not satisfy the tolerance of minimum support threshold \(min_sup Conjectural set begins from the tolerance of minimum support threshold to believable set \(min_sup the constant ? is the range of conjectural set. In addition, support counts in conjectural set approximate to the threshold, and they probably transfer their state when next sequence comes into the sequence database According to the growth of sequence database minimum support count changes rapidly, one sequence satisfies minimum support currently but perhaps not in next time period and vice versa. Hence, members in conjectural set are not stable and some of them possibly transfer to questionable set or believable set Similarly, the state transformation could be happened in questionable and believable sets Whenever a new sequence comes into the sequence database, the minimum support count adds this record and it does not cause the sequence database with rapid changes in questionable and believable sets. In conjectural set, the minimum support threshold of each sequence is very close, and we separate this part to be a dynamic checking section. The sequences in conjectural set could transfer into believable set very soon. Therefore, the conjectural set can be seen as a buffer between questionable and believable sets Table 1.

Definitions Table 1 summarizes the notations used throughout the paper with a brief description of its semantics Besides, more details about definitions are showing as follows In generally, learning behavior is a serial of learning elements, which increase in proper sequence Besides, these learning elements usually specific in certain order, ex. Start from core curricula to advance topic. Suppose one learning element read or practice by certain learner for several times, we can say the learner may need more learning elements which relevant that one. Moreover, the learning behavior which learns certain learning element repeatedly can not be seen as a proper behavior. In this case, we divide the repeat behavior to different part, and let every learning element in a learning sequence is unique. Definition 1 and 2 define the learning sequence and valid learning sequence respectively Definition 1: A learning sequence S = &lt; s1, s2  si &gt is a logical unit of learning behaviors characterized by a serial of learning elements &lt; s1, s2  si &gt Definition 2: Consider a valid learning sequence Sxy lt; Sx, Sy &gt; combined with Sx = &lt; x1, x2  xi&gt; and Sy lt; y1, y2  yi&gt;, where Sx, Sy and Sxy? S. Following t h a t   f o r  x i  i n  S x   s u c h  t h a  y S  a n d  f o r  y t  i x i  x S x     t ySy i i n  S y   s u c h  t h a  S x i y i    Example 1: Suppose there are two learning sequences S1 = &lt; A, B, C, D &gt; and S2 = &lt; A, A, B, C &gt;, where S1 and S2?S. Besides, S1 is a valid learning sequence but S2 is not Learning sequence is characterized by a serial of learning elements and the relationship between these learning elements is strongly order relation. The strongly order relation means two learning elements occur by certain order and successively in one sequence. In order to analyze the learning sequence learning sequence has to separate in several parts of subsequence within different length and position Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence \(WI  05 0-7695-2415-X/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE Furthermore, these subsequences also need to follow the strongly order relationship, which inherit from the origin learning sequence. A definition of analyzable subsequence defines in definition 3 Definition 3: Consider a valid learning sequence Sb lt; bj+1, bj+2  bj+k &gt; is a subsequence of valid learning sequence Sa = &lt; a1, a2  ai &gt;, where Sb is a continuous part of Sa. If and only if the following conditions hold: 1  1; 3 Example 2: Consider three valid learning sequences S1 lt; A, B, C, D, E &gt;, S2 = &lt; A, B, C &gt; and S3 = &lt; B, C E &gt;, where S2 is a subsequence of S1 but S3 is not a subsequence of S2. Because S2 still keeps the strongly order relation which inherit from S1, but S3 do not hold it The goal of mining learning behavior is to discover the latent strongly order relationship between two learning sequences. In addition, we use association rule to represent the mining result. In order to fit in with our learning behavior definition, we modify the 


with our learning behavior definition, we modify the original definition of imply represent association rules and the new definition shows in definition 4 Definition 4: Imply successive appearance; it contains support and confidence values. Besides, the ranges of the two values are between 0% and 100 Example 3: An association rule &lt;A&gt; ? &lt;B&gt; [support 20%, confidence = 60%] means least 20% of all sequences, which shows &lt;A&gt; and &lt;B&gt; occur continuous and together. Furthermore, it also indicates when &lt;A&gt; appears then in 60% cases &lt;B&gt; also appears successively 4. The Proposed Algorithm The incrementally sequential mining can be decomposed to two phases: 1 Adjusting phase, each of the detail shows as following sections 4.1. Adding Phase The objective in adding phase is separating new learning sequence into several parts of subsequences for mining analysis. In this phase, we apply n-gram [4 to scan the new learning sequence and generate useful subsequences for analyzing. Furthermore, in order to generate all possible combination of subsequence, the scan width of n-gram is setting from 1 to the length of new learning sequence. Each generated subsequence matches with learning sequence existed in sequence database. Suppose the subsequence pattern already existed in sequence database, and then increase the count of the sequence pattern. On the other hand, the sequence patterns do not exist in sequence database and then insert the sequence pattern into sequence database Procedure AddSequence \(D, S begin 1. let S := a new valid learning sequence 2. let Sxy := valid learning sequences 3. let n := 1 4. repeat 5. Sxy := subsequences of S which is produced by scan S with \(n 6. for each subsequence do 7. if 8.  Count\(Sxy Sxy 9. else 10.  create Sxy in D 11.

Algorithm for adding new sequence into sequence database Figure 2 shows pseudo code for AddSequence algorithm, which provides the solution to add sequences into the sequence database. In the iteration of the repeat loop, which spanning steps 4-21, each Sxy is produced by scan S with n-gram. Following that steps 7-8 shows that Sxy existed in D, and then add 1 to Count\(Sxy sets Count\(Sxy 


sets Count\(Sxy procedure to adjust sequences which lie in conjectural set Count\(Sxy than one elements in Sxy. If the sequence satisfies these two conditions together, Sxy transfers to believable set  4.2. Adjusting Phase Following the adding phase, the occurrences information of sequence database has been changed Besides, this change causes some subsequence patterns need to shift its state, especially the patterns belong to conjectural set. The adjusting phase designed three algorithms to handle the pattern state shifting and each algorithm server specific sequence set respectively. In Figure 3, AdjustConjectruralSet algorithm adjusts Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence \(WI  05 0-7695-2415-X/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE sequences in conjectural set criterion of adjusting is based on the occurrences of subsequence pattern. The subsequence patterns  occurrences increase when a new learning sequence insert into sequence database. The incensement causes the range of conjectural set becomes wilder and lets the support threshold higher. The adjusting algorithms detect these variations and updating patterns  states to hold the stability of sequence database Procedure AdjustConjecturalSet begin 1. for each Sxy in ? do 2. if \(Count\(Sxy min_sup * |D 3.      move Sxy from ? to 4. create association rules that Sx?Sy 5. else 6. if \(Count\(Sxy min_sup * |D 7.  move Sxy from ? to 8. endif 9. endif 10 end Figure 3. Algorithm for adjusting sequences in conjectural set The AdjustConjecturalSet algorithm is shown in Figure 3, which checks the support counts of sequences and adjusts sequences in conjectural set Assume that the support count of sequences satisfy minimum support threshold, then transfer the sequences to believable set corresponding association rules Sx?Sy. Oppositely any support counts of sequences less than the tolerance of minimum support threshold in conjectural set then transfer these sequences to questionable set 5. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we have proposed a real-time leaning algorithm to improve traditional sequential mining method. Owing to the rapid growing amount of data this algorithm uses the incremental data mining technique to enhance the efficiency of mining each learner  s behavior log. Besides, we divide the sequence database, used to dynamically generate association rules, into three sets to reduce the computation time. Those association rules provide guidance to learners for making learning decisions Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank the National Science Council of the Republic of China for financially supporting this research under Contract No NSC 94-2524-S-006 -001 References 1] R.

As will become clear later both of these enhancements allow load on a link to be expressed as a continuous function which in turn simplies our worst-case analysis Neither enhancement alters the worst-case input signicantly First during an epoch at most one item occurrence per input stream can have non-integral weight Second any input with real-valued item frequencies can be transformed into an input with nearly integral frequencies that yields identical results by multiplying each frequency by a large number and dividing all answers produced by the same number For notational ease we transform the problem of setting  2  l  1 to that of setting  2   l  1  where for all 2  i  l  2   i   i   i 1 and  l  1   l  1  It is required that  i  0 for all 2  i  l  1  and that  l  1 i 2  i   1   i denotes the precision margin at level i  i.e the difference between the error tolerances at level i and level i 1  Let the vector     2   3   l  1  Let I denote the contents of all input streams S 1 S m during a single epoch Let I denote the set of all possible instances of I  Given an input I  a communication hierarchy T dened by degree d and number of levels l  and a setting of the precision gradient   let w represent the maximum load on any link in the communication hierarchy w  I T    max k  links     load  k   Worst-case load W is dened as W  T    max I I  w  I T    Given a communication hierarchy T  the objective is to set  such that the worst-case load W  T   is minimized We rst show that it is sufcient to consider a specic subset of all instances of the general problem for worstcase analysis Then we nd precision gradient values  values that cause the worst-case load under any of these instances to be minimal There exists a subset I wc of the set of all input instances I such that for all instances I II wc  there exists an instance I  I wc such that for any T    w  I   T    w  I T    Hence I wc denotes the set of worst-case inputs  Instance I is a member of I wc if and only if it satises each of the following three properties P1 For any two input streams S i and S j  there is no item occurrence common to both S i and S j  P2  For any input stream S i  all items occurring in S i occur with equal frequency P3  For any two input streams S i and S j  both the number of item occurrences and the number of distinct items in S i and S j are equal Lemma 4 For xed T and   given any input instance I  it is possible to nd an input instance I  I wc such that w  I   T    w  I T    Proof Our proof of Lemma 4 is rather involved and is provided in  From Lemma 4 we know it is sufcient to consider the set I wc for worst-case communication load Hence we can rewrite our expression for W  T   as W  T    max I I wc  w  I T    Property P3 of I wc implies that the total number of item occurrences at any leaf node is the same Let n denote this number   S i   n for all 1  i  m  Let tc  j  denote the total number of item occurrences arriving on streams monitored by at the leaf nodes of a subtree rooted at a node at level j  It is easy to see that tc  j  d  l  1  j   n  where l is the number of levels in the communication hierarchy and d is the fanout of all non-leaf nodes The next lemma shows that worst-case inputs induce a high degree of symmetry on the resulting synopses Lemma 5 For any input instance I I wc  the following two properties hold for the d j   j  1 synopses relayed by the d j levelj nodes to their parents 1 No item is present in more than one synopsis 2 The estimated frequency counts corresponding to any two items even if present in two different synopses have the same value Proof See  Due to the high degree of symmetry formalized in Lemma 5 the count for each item is eliminated due to being decremented and falling below zero at the same level of the communication hierarchy Let us call this level x  If all counts are dropped at the leaf level then x  l  1  If all counts are retained through the entire process and are sent to the root node R level 0  then x 0  Otherwise all counts are dropped at some intermediate level 1  x  l  2  The most heavily loaded link\(s are the ones leading to level x  To see why consider that no data is transmitted on subsequent links and previous links have lower load since data is spread more thinly in any communication hierarchy T  the number of links between levels decreases monotonically as data moves from leaves to the root When synopses are combined at nodes of level i using Algorithm 1 the frequency count estimate of each item is decremented by the quantity tc  i    i let Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simplied to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2

l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no benet to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are dened over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modied to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3 Experimental

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
