Abstract--Wireless 
in Ad hoc mode In an Infrastructure mode mobile stations communicate with each other with the help of Base Station or Access Point AP It is similar to star topology of wired network This Access Point makes communication easier between the nodes In an Ad hoc mode there is no access point or base station that helps in communication between nodes All nodes in wireless Ad hoc network directly communicate with each other in peer-to-peer fashion The topology of wireless Ad hoc network is dynamic in nature therefore routes are changed frequently Wireless Ad hoc network has no routers Each node act as an intermediate node for other node and intermediate node forwards data towards destination 
node An intermediate node is also a sender for other nodes and acts as a router in the network The major factors which affect the data transmission of an Ad hoc network are battery power bandwidth delay speed type of data and cost The data transfer rates in a wireless Ad hoc network are not static but are dynamic The availability of these resources at any node either during data transmission or forwarding of data to other node is not certain The resources available at any node are in scarce The optimized use of any of these resources is a big question Battery power is one of the major factors in a wireless Ad hoc network A node can transmit data 
to a longer distance only if it has sufficient battery power Area covered by a node in an Ad hoc network plays an important role during data transmission In this paper our main focus is on utilization of battery power available at any node for data transmission Here we propose two algorithms for optimization of battery power that find out nodes which wants to transmit the data and the total power consumption in wireless Ad hoc network

Keywords 
network can be created with the help of Access Point AP or without AP A network with AP is called infrastructure network  AP performs node selection and route selection in the network This type of network calculates route selection in advance Ad hoc mode can be deployed anywhere easily without requiring major infrastructure It is a decentralized network Users are mobile in this network they can access data from anywhere Data transmission in wireless Ad hoc mode from source node to destination node requires help of other nodes presents in the vicinity of a node As a node they behave as a source and destination and as a router or intermediate node they forward data for other nodes The major characteristics 
of wireless Ad hoc network are Dynamic topology easy deployment limited bandwidth limited battery power lower data rates higher error rates higher delay etc The resources available at a node in wireless Ad hoc network are in scarce Topology of wireless Ad hoc network changes rapidly and re-organizes them-selves in an arbitrary fashion  There may be many possible routes available between two nodes over which data can flow and each path may have different available capacity that mayor may not meet the quality of service requirements of the desired service For a wireless Ad hoc network we can consider many factors which affect the overall working of it These factors are bandwidth battery power memory speed cost type 
of data delay etc As the network topology changes the distance between source and destination may vary time to time If a wireless Ad hoc network deployed in such area where power is not available in ample amount then optimized use of battery power and resources is essential The battery power required to transmit the data from source to destination may also vary as topology changes A node can easily transmit data to a distant node if it has sufficient battery power A node transmits its data to other node without any interference if node lies in its vicinity A large battery power is required to transmit the data to a node which is situated too far from source node After few transmissions 
a node reaches to its threshold battery level and it may exclude from network path After some time all the nodes may not be available during data transmission and the overall life time of the network may decreases II RELATED WORK Many researchers have concentrated their work in the area of resources available in the wireless Ad hoc network Das Sudipto and Rajesh Roy have discussed about the high mobility and link failure in mobile Ad hoc network and require frequent route discoveries Wireless Ad hoc network follows many approaches for routing to save resources  9 Marc Mosko

vibration sensor controlled by ATtiny26 with a programmable filter, \(v\mperature sens or and \(vi\se sensor The second layer includes a data concentrator system developed using AVR32UC3 microcontroller that allows a strong power management for all internal drivers and plays several roles, such as: manages the communication channels between itself and the sensors, assures the filtering of the ECG signal correlates the SpO 2 signal with ECG and vibration signal in order to avoid the artifacts and prepares the telegram that will be transmitted to PDHA, respectively to HS The third layer includes the PDHA \(HTC Hero PDA that assures the multi-modal interface between the patient and the remote monitoring system The fourth layer includes a PC as hospital server \(HS connected to the Internet. This se rver offers an interface to the health care professional that surveys the patients. Into the patients’ data base implemented on the HS all the patient’s vital signs are stored once per day in normal regime and continously in case of alarm or emergency Figure  7 Architectural overview of BIOMEDTEL patient remote monitor The hardware implementation illustrated in Figure 8. corresponds to the first layer of the above described system. This layer includes all the sensors placed on the patient: wearable ECG Ag/AgCl or stainless steel electrodes, accelerometer sensor, blood pressure monitor and SpO 2 sensor The wearable ECG system was designed in compliance with the BS EN 60601/2/25/1995 medical standard for the protection of the patient and was implemented to acquire the biopotential from one bipolar D1 derivation Figure  8 Prototype of the first layer of BIOMEDTEL project The experimental results related to ECG acquisition are illustrated in Figure 9 Figure  9. ECG record obtained with our implemented system while resting In order to avoid the movement artifacts, the system was designed with a vibration \(absolute 3D acceleration\ sensor placed on the patient’s stern. In order to create the proper and similar conditions for ECG recordi ng, the patient is advertised by his PDHA with an audio message to take the correct position for signal acquiring. During ECG recording, the patient’s status is verified by using the ADXL 330 accelerometer. The leads of the ECG channel and also the accelerometer were placed onto the same wearable support. Another major aspect is related to the accelerometer sensor which can provide information about pulmonary and cardiac activities such as respiratory rhythm and cardiac rate The cardiac activity of a resting patient is illustrated in Figure 10 Figure  10 Cardiac activity and breath respiration 
 


The illustrated grey signal represents a not filtered signal and the magenta one represents the corresponding filtered one From the amplitude of the signals it can be seen that the X axis is not so sensitive at the cardiac activity, the Y axis correctly follows the cardiac activity, the peak to peak amplitude being 30 mV and the Z axis is the most sensitive. In clinostats position of patient Z axis will give information about the local gravitational acceleration. This signal could be used as auto calibration signal for all the axis of the acceleration sensor These signals are crucial because they can make easier and accurate the detection and classification of the signal records and can improve the process of status detection of the patient Also, an important bio-physical parameter is the cardiac rhythm information provided by the blood pressure. To acquire the cardiac rhythm it was used an existing Blood pressure device \(VISOMAT400 endowed with an OMRON chipset\ that was adapted thus to be able to communicate with a Bluetooth transceiver \(LMX9838\which transmits the acquired data to the concentrator able to co llect and to interpret them For monitoring SpO 2 it was used the classical method developed by Beer-Lambert to analyze the signals acquired by a dedicated sensor with a dual LED \(IR and Red\d phototransistor \(SF-1011N-Nellcor\to the finger of the patient or at the ear level. This signa l is continuously monitored and represents the leading signal n ecessary to control the regimes of the whole remote patient monitor. In order to offer a high confidence and reliability of the recorded data, this signal was used as referen For monitoring the glucose level from the blood it was used the DEXCOM Seven instrument, which uses a nano-tube carbon sensor implanted in the belly of the patient. The communication with data concentrator is wireless RFM Our set of smart sensors used by the remote patient monitor could be used with high efficiency and accuracy by patients having cardiac, neuronal or metabolic diseases IV A LGORITHMS HEARTRONIC ALGORITHM FOR CLASSIFYING ECG ABNOMALITIES An ECG represents the electrical voltage in the heart during a contraction. Many waves, segments and intervals can be found in the ECG graphic i n d irre g u l ar beat s, t h es e  components have to be searched with signal analysis methods The ECG front-end processing algorithms encompass 5 phases that were already listed in s ection 3.B.1 when the WPU was described Figure 11 shows an example of an ECG lead I, with the marks of the ECG’s components Figure  11 Visualization of an ECG’s Lead I example, with components marks As previously noted, the most commonly used clinical lead configuration is the 12-lead ECG system, which provides twelve waveforms, called leads. To provide such a 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient’s body and the signals from these electrodes are processed to provide the twelve leads The Heartronic algorithms do not use 12-lead ECG. Only the Orthogonal Frank’s leads X, Y, Z \(8 sensors\ are needed 8 The 12 ECG traces can be obtained by the Frank’s Leads Vectorcardiography T h e 12 E C G traces can be obtained by the Frank’s Leads using Vectorcardiography. Effective filtering algorithms were developed to el iminate harmful baseline fluctuation and possible motion artifacts of the sensors used It was assumed that sampling rate is 512 Hz, which is a suitable choice considering that all the information of the ECG signal is contained in the range of frequencies below 100 Hz The algorithm is composed by several blocks Orthogonalisation reduces the dimension of the signals processed in latter stages Pre-processing reduces the baseline wander, power line interference and electromyographic noise Segmentation finds the individual beats by finding the onset of P wave, the R-peak and the offset of T wave Alignment reduces changes due to respiration and body position changes Matching accounts for the remaining variation Decision takes action if the vectorcardiogram \(VCG loops and there are other anomalies Most of the literature concen trates on immobile patient measurements, which is a considerably easier task than the one where the patient is moving around during measurement. For example, plain heart rate measurement is much less demanding than full ECG analysis Body position changes, respiration and movement cause physical movement of the heart, which in turn is shown as changes in the measured ECG. What is more, these motion artifacts can be quite severe and may easily cause false alarm. Hence, many change detection methods are very vulnerable to these effects. Consequently, the aim of the first set of algorithms is to be insensitive to this kind of normal variation but sensitive to any abnormal changes The sensitivity at which the arrhythmia recognition algorithms should be set is a problem. High sensitivity of the system will be connected with numerous false positive alarms because of false ST monitoring alarms and muscle artifact simulating ventricular tachycar dia\Low sensitivity may result in misdiagnosis of the potentially life threatening conditions Furthermore ECG monitoring does not supply sufficient information necessary to evaluate the cardiac function as a pump It might limit preventive and diagnostic use of Heartronic especially in patients with heart failure There are almost no published trials con cern i ng cardia c  remote monitoring so it is difficult to develop an algorithm supported by published research BIOMED TEL The algorithm developed on the data concentrator \(second 
 


layer\ the cardiac rhythm by detecting the R wave and after that the R-R intervals from ECG signal. A similar operation is realized for SpO2 signal and the result obtained is compared with the first one. This represents a first verification of the accuracy of the acquired data. A second verification consists in analysis of the signal provided by the vibration sensor The validation is based on the initial calibration values for the Z axis of the sensor used to detect the orthostatic position of the patient during the ECG signal acquisition. On the third layer of the system the trend of the main parameters \(SpO 2 values, cardiac rate, blood pressure and glucoses concentration is determined. The parameters are correlated using a decision table based on a fuzzy set with above mentioned data. Before home usage of the remote patient monitor, the patient’s specific thresholds are settled on PDHA by the physician in hospital As result of signal analysis the patient monitor will change automatically his functioning regime from normal mode, to alarm respectively to emergency mode. In the first case, the data acquired will be only once per day uploaded to the hospital server, and in case of an alarm occurs, the significant signal will be continuously transmitted to HS. In emergency situation case when more than two threshold values are overpasses, all the signals acquired from the patient will be transmitted in real time to HS. In this case the HS is able to transmit in “real-time advises of the physician to the patient in order to prevent the possible dangerous situations V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK The development of a wearable system capable of continuously monitoring and analyzing the heart condition of patients with known risk cardiovascular diseases should allow patients to go on with a normal life, while improving its quality and increasing its expectation The goal of this collaboration is to improve the results of both projects by means of comparing methods and coming up with better solutions for the technologic challenges Heartronic project is more focused on ECG signal processing, using with a large leads number \(12\ and strong detection of arrhythmic symptoms by intelligent algorithms, comparing with BiomedTel project that is more oriented to analysis of SpO2 signal continuously monitored, and that uses only one derivation for ECG signal. As result of sensor configuration Heartronic project was oriented mo re to the detailed analysis of acquired ECG signal. In case of BiomedTel the focus is oriented to the correlation between a set of signals acquired from patient and the local signal processing is more simplified The interface between the remote unit and hospital server is almost similar for both projects and present also a similar functionality. A special remark could be done related the communication strategy adopted by BiomedTel project, where the PDHA uses a dynamic allocation of the communication channel. In this sense an energy efficient algorithm that scans and chooses the most reliable and efficient communication channel was implemented Currently the architectures of both projects presented in this paper are being compared for effectiveness and accuracy and the collaboration is expected to provide new methods to solve technical issues that for the challenges posed It is obvious that including new signals to be monitored and also improving the inter correlatio n between signals acquired in parallel with the development of a strong energy management strategy for all system components will make possible to assure a more safe, available and precise instrumentation that could aid the patients in the future Future developments include implementation of such methods on both systems and field tests to assess the improvements A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors gratefully acknowledge the collaboration of the other partners in the Heartron ic project: ACTA Service \(IT ESAPROJEKT \(PL\, I2M Design \(E\T-Connect \(I\nvePL\, University of Oulu \(FIN Camillo Hospital \(I This research was supported by Romanian Ministry of Education and Research in the frame of PN II BIOMED TEL D11057/2007 national program.

Minimal effort is assumed for the adaptation of these specific MSAP components for this missi on, and efforts will be concentrated on re-testing these mechanisms. It is assumed that the flight software is only responsible for the high-level control of the flight components, with no role in the software components for the individual instruments. There are no data analysis components onboard, and the data is only stored and sent back. All implementations of the flight software are done in-house and fully co-located. The estimated development time is 71.1 work-years, an equivalent of 210.3k lines of code Telecommunication The telecommunication subsystem requires two-way X Band communications throughout the mission. The requirements for downlink data rates using the 34-meter Deep Space Network depend on the separation between the spacecraft and Earth and are listed in Table 4 Distance between the spacecraft and Earth Downlink data rate 3.66 AU 75 kbps 4.5 AU 50 kbps 6.4 AU 25 kbps  Table 4 Requirements for downlink data rates  The command bit error rate \(BER\ired to be 1e-5 and the telemetry frame error rate \(FER\required to be 1e-4 A minimum link margin of 3 db is required in the communication links The pointing error depends on the beamwidth of the antenna and assumes the pointing loss to be less than 1 dB. The high gain antenna \(HGA\is pointed within 0.2 degrees, the medium gain antenna \(MGA\inted within 10 degrees and the low gain antenna \(LGA\inted within 45 degrees.  The design assumes an error correcting 1/6 turbo code with 8920 bit frames for high rate links, and an error correcting 1/6 turbo code with 1784 bit frames for low data rate links The subsystem is a fully redundant X-Band deep space system.  It contains two sm all deep space transponders SDST\or X-Band uplink and downlink \(with single redundancy\There are two traveling wave tube amplifiers TWTA\, each outputting 30 W.  The X-Band high gain antenna is 3-meter parabolic dish with a single axis gimbal and has a gain of 45 db. A medium gain horn with a half power beamwidth \(HPBW\of 20 degrees, and two low gain antennas with a combined HPBW of 90 degrees are operated during safe mode.  The horn and the omni antennas operate at 10 kbps with the 70 meter DSN dish in safe mode. The system has two diplexers which allow the use of a single antenna for both uplink and downlink. The hybrid splits/ combines the signals while the Waveguide Transfer Switch \(WGTS\nd the Coax Switch \(CXS\required for switching the antennas. The total estimated mass of the telecommunication subsystem is 51.3 kg, with a peak transmit power of 64 W and a minimum \(receiver on\r of 12 W 6.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
