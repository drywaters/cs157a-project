Estimation of Wind Power Variation and Availability for Multiple Wind Farms  Yi Zhang Student Member  IEEE and  Yibin Zhang Department of Smart Grid Research State Grid Energy Research Institute Beijing, China Email zhangyi@sgeri.sgcc.com.cn and zhangyibin@sgeri.sgcc.com.cn   Abstract 227Due to its intermittent nature, integrating large quantities of wind power in power systems has serious impacts on power system operation. Wind power increases the load variation 
and the reserve requirements for contingencies. Utilities are especially concerned about the wind power availability during the peak load demand time. In this paper, the wind power variation and availability for multiple wind farms distributed in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico are analyzed based on actual wind data. Considering multiple wind farms as part of one big wind farm distributed over a large area can decrease the wind power variation and increase the total wind power availability Keywords- Wind power availability, wind power correlation and 
variation I   I NTRODUCTION  Smart Grid is defined differently by many countries and areas. However, reliability is concerned by all of them especially when a large amount of renewable energy is connected to the grid. Wind power is an intermittent resource which varies continuously. The main concern about wind power is that there is not enough spinning reserve in the system when wind stop blowing, which may result in blackout in high wind power penetration cases Wind energy can provide a part of the electrical demand 
but consumer cannot rely completely on wind powered electric energy because it is not available all the time Conventional generators, such as coal-fired and hydro plants have nominal ratings and their operational output can move between minimum and maximum rating freely. However wind turbines are different from them because input wind speed is not controllable as steam or water flow. The output of wind turbines follows the wind speed when the wind speed is between the cut-in and nominal speed of the wind turbines Therefore more reserve capacity is needed when more wind turbines are integrated into 
the power system. Reference  reviewed some analytic and utility case studies cases on the impacts of wind power on existing power systems. There was not a definite conclusion given in [1  ho w e ve r  i t sho w e d t ha t  the integration costs increases with size as integrating wind power requires more reserve. The cost becomes more with higher penetration Fig. 1 is the 50-meter wind resource map of the United States T h e dark er colo r repres en ts h i g h e r w i n d s p eed National Renewable Energy Laboratory \(NREL\as a database on wind speed of western areas in th  10minute average wind speeds were saved in this database

 The cross-correlations shown in Table I are calculated based on 10 minute wind speeds. A, B, and C are in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico, respectively. The distances of AB, BC, and AC are about 300 km, 400 km, and 600 km, respectively. In this paper, summer and winter are defined as from May 1 to October 31 and from November 1 to April 30, respectively. The wind data from May 1, 2005 to October 31, 2006 is analysis in this paper. In Table I, all the numbers are positive except cross-correlation between A and C in summer, which means any of two time series are correlated except A and C. Locations A and B are more correlated than other pairs, possibly because they are geographically closest amongst all the locations. Location A and C are least correlated perhaps due to the fact that they are farther apart TABLE I W IND S PEEDS C ROSS CORRELATION AMONG THE L OCATIONS  a W IND SPEEDS CROSS CORRELATION AMONG THE LOCATIONS IN SUMMER  Site Name A B C A NA 0.3290 -0.0053 B - NA 0.2498 C - - NA  b IND SPEEDS CROSS CORRELATION AMONG THE LOCATIONS IN W INTER  Site Name A B C A NA 0.7201 0.2634 B - NA 0.6493 C - - NA  High wind power penetration has many impacts on power systems. One is that unpredictable wind power can increase the load variations and forecasting errors dramatically [1  This is true for large individual wind farms with high capacity but if the capacity is distributed throughout many locations the variation might not be as big as an individual farm [5   Assume the capacity of each location is 30 MW, so the combination is 90 MW. The output power of wind turbines can be estimated via the power curves given by their manufacturers. In this paper, GE 1.5SLE is used. Its power curve is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows hourly average wind power at the three locations and their combined effect. The capacity of each location is scaled from 30 MW to 90 MW which is the total capacity of the three locations, then the standard deviation of each locatio n with scaled capacity can be compared with that of the combination The output power of the combination is the average of the three locations, but its standard deviation is reduced from that of the individual three. All th ree locations are not completely correlated, so they can cancel parts of the variations of each other, therefore, its variation is overestimated as far as the impacts on the system is concerned. Currently the impacts of wind farms on the power system are studied as individual farms   Fig. 2 GE 1.5 MW wind turbine power curve [6   37,227 31,687 33,319 34,078 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 A B C Combination Power Produced \(kW Location  a\mmer 53,895 48,334 45,350 49,193 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 A B C Combination Power Produced \(kW Location  b\Winter Fig. 3 Hourly average wind power with standard deviation  III  W IND P OWER A VAILABILITY  For this study, let us assume no scheduled outage or maintenance in the wind farms. The generation only depends on the local wind speed, i.e., the wind turbines will produce electricity if wind speed is between the wind turbines cut-in and cut-out speeds. The output of wind turbines will follow 


 their power curves. The wind turbines used in this paper are GE 1.5SLE and its power curve is shown in cu ti n  rated and cut-out speeds are 3.5 m/s, 14 m/s and 25 m/s respectively 10 minute average wind speeds for four days of summer July 30 to August 2, 2005\d winter \(January 30 to February 2, 2006\re plotted and shown in Fig. 4. From the 10 minute average wind speeds of all locations, it can be found that the wind speeds of the three locations are seldom below the cut-in speed \(3.5 m/s\ and above the cut-out speed 25 m/s\ at the same time. In other words, these locations are able to partly compensate each others no wind condition due to geographcal dispersion  Fig. 5 shows the wind power availability \(the time of wind turbine producing power over the total time during this period of each location and their combination. The percentage of time wind power is unavailable \(wind speed lower than 3.5 m/s or higher than 25 m/s\ is from 12.73% to 16.90% in summer and from 9.05% to 17.08% in winter for an individual location Transmission system operators have to increase the reserve requirements to backup the wind power when a new wind farm is connected to the grid. Bigger wind farms need higher reserves. But if multiple wind farms are considered, the wind unavailable time decreases. The percentage of wind unavailable time is 0.71% in summer and 0.13% in winter when the three locations are co nsidered together as one big wind farm distributed over a large geographical area  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1 101 201 301 401 501 Wind Speed \(m/s Time \(x 10 minutes A B C  a\mmer  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1 101 201 301 401 501 Wind Speed \(m/s Time \(x 10 minutes A B C  b\winter Fig. 4 10 minute wind speed for four days

Real wind data from three locations in western areas in the United States is used in this paper. Compared with each location, the combination of the three locations can increase the wind availability and decrease the wind power variation. The spinning reserve for wind power could be reduced if multiple wind farms distributed over a large geographical area are considered as one large wind farm R EFERENCES  1  B. Parsons, M.

strengthen as time progresses. Accounting for time, we hypothesize H3b: Tenure moderates the relationship between commitment and favorable user behavior in a way that members who have longer tenure with community show a higher level favorable user behavior, if they are more committed than members who are new to the community Satisfaction is an ex post evaluation of member experience with the community. Researchers describe it as a positive feeling, indifference or a negative feeling [2]. Most satisfaction definitions in literature focus on the evaluation of single transactions or exchanges [e.g., 37]. However, we follow the approach by Anderson, Fornell and Lehmann [1] and define satisfaction in this study as an overall evaluation based on the experience with a service over time. This cumulative perspective to customer satisfaction is measured with a multi-dimensional construct [e.g., 6 covering various aspects of satisfaction with the community. Hereby, it is mainly directed at the community provider and the technical platform per se Satisfaction in general is said to be positively related to service usage [7]. Users of online communities adapt their participation level in the community by maximizing their subjective utility obtained from the virtual community [8]. Therefore, a high level of satisfaction should lead to a high level of participation \(content should also increase the intention to stay \(loyalty willingness to promote the community to other people growth revenue H4: Satisfaction is positively related to favorable user behavior  3. Methodology  To receive meaningful results for our exploratory research questions, we settled for a quantitative research strategy. In our context we supplemented the data from the online survey with observational data from the logfiles of the game provider  3.1. Sample and Procedure  The MMOG community Travian evolves around a browser-based online game with more than 3.3 million users playing in the beginning of 2008. The game itself is a real-time strategy game \(RTS chieftains of their own villages and seek to gain natural resources, build armies and expand their realms. The game is timed to last approximately one year. Each Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 server is a closed game environment and holds approx 25,000 users on maximum In March 2007, we conducted a survey on one of the German servers. Moreover, we were able to obtain the logfiles of the players since they entered the game Of the 17,495 users playing Travian on our selected German world, 1,895 filled out our survey. Deleting those records which included missing values or outliers left us with 1,389 records. Of these, we were able to match each record with the data of the logfiles The average age of users playing Travian is 21.8 ranging from 12 to 50. Of these users, a share of 24 is female. The lion's share of users is currently engaged in education \(67 employed or self-employed. 5% of the users are not working e.g. being unemployed. The dispensable income per month is 211 Euros on average \(see 


Appendix 1  3.2. Measures  Dependent Variable. Ratings of the four dimensions of favorable user behavior were obtained from the user survey. Content was assessed by a single item, asking the users how often they write articles in the community forum. For this, we used a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of never? and ?always?. Revenue was measured with a single item on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 by asking the users how often they are paying fees for extra services in the game. Again, the anchors of the scale were ?never? and ?always Loyalty was measured with a single item by asking for the users' intention to stay in the game. It was assessed by a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?absolutely not? and ?absolutely Growth was operationalized by a single item asking the users if they would to recommend Travian to other people. It was measured with a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?absolutely not? and ?absolutely Independent Variables. Cross-over with offline social networks was measured by the number of fellow Travian players a user also knows in his or her offline life. Commitment was assessed by a single item, asking the users whether they felt committed to the community. For this, we used a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?absolutely not? and ?absolutely?. Tenure indicates how long the user has been a member of the game. We obtained this variable through matching the logfiles of the server to the survey data. Satisfaction is an aggregated measure of four items asking users about their level of satisfaction with Travian. The single items were whether they felt enough support from the community whether  the community fulfilled their expectations whether there was a good atmosphere in the community, and whether they were satisfied with the community in general. Again, we applied a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of absolutely not? and ?absolutely? for each scale point This measure showed good reliability with a Cronbach?s ? of 0.86 Control Variables. We controlled for Age, Gender Currently not working \(employment status in education \(pupils, student, etc achieved \(highest educational achievement active internet usage was measured by the extent to which users participate in online chats, online communities and forums/newsgroups. This was measured on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?never? and ?always Hours online was assessed by the number of hours the users were logged in into the community each day Dispensable income was measured by asking each user for the amount of money they had available for their hobbies each month. The willingness to pay reflects the general willingness of the users to pay for online games and was measured by asking whether they spend money on online games. This was assessed on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?never? and ?always  3.3. Analyses  Table A1 in the appendix provides bivariate correlation coefficients. We also checked our data for multicollinearity and computed variance inflation factors \(VIF 


factors \(VIF a problem since none of the VIF values exceeded 10 26]. Moreover, the large size of our sample allows the estimation method we applied to provide robust coefficient estimates To estimate our model, we applied simultaneous estimation of a system of structural regression equations via three-stage least squares \(simultaneousequation models allowed us to answer a set of interrelated research questions in a single, systematic, and comprehensive analysis and to account for the potential interdependencies among our four success dimensions Ignoring simultaneity would lead to biased coefficients 23]. Simultaneous-equation models are conceptually related to so-called Structural Equation Modelling SEM relationships among multiple independent and dependent constructs. Applying a technology acceptance model to an e-commerce adoption setting Gefen et al. [22] showed that linear regression techniques and SEM result in consistent and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 remarkably similar results. However, SEM is usually employed when latent variables are to be addressed [5 With this paper, this is not the case. Obviously, several of our constructs could also been conceptualized as latent variables. However, we confined ourselves to using proxying variables. Moreover, when using statistical software such as LISREL in order to employ SEMs, researchers usually aim at analyzing the overall model fit [22]. Since the objective of this analysis is to solely analyze the effects between independent and dependent variables, we deem regression-based simultaneous-equation models as the adequate method Table 2.

Firstly, instead of using simultaneous estimation techniques, we estimated the four equations depicted in Table 2 independently using OLS. These results have been fairly consistent with those reported in Table 2. Secondly, recall that our dependent variable has been surveyed applying a Likert-type scale Accordingly, these variables are censored Consequently, we also estimated four independent Tobit regressions which account for this characteristic of the dependent variable. By employing OLS or Tobit regression techniques, an equi-distant measure is assumed to operationalize the dependent variable Third, to provide additional robustness of our model we also estimated four independent ordered probit models. Since the results did not change in a major way, they have been omitted here  3.4. Results  Table 2 reports the estimation results of our simultaneous-equation model including four equations with contant, revenue, loyaty and growth as dependent variables. According to hypothesis H1, we expected the cross-over between online and offline social networks to be positively related with favorable user behavior. Indeed, cross-over with offline social networks is positively significant with most of our dependent variables. The larger the cross-over, the higher users? production of content \(0.039 with p 0.01 dependent variable.

With the exception of loyalty, we can confirm our hypothesis H1. H2 hypothesized that commitment to the community is positively related to favorable user behavior.

effect can be observed \(0.130 with p ? 0.01 is true with growth \(0.101 with p ? 0.01 commitment is associated with a higher loyalty and a higher propensity to recommend the game to others Again, with one exception, we can confirm H2. In H3a we hypothesized that the time spent in the community tenure Here, the number of weeks the user has played the game is positive and significant with content \(0.019 with p ? 0.05 revenue, loyalty and growth as dependent variable are insignificant. Consequently, we are only able to confirm H3a for one of our success dimensions Hypothesis H3b included the interaction of tenure and commitment. None of the models shows a significant effect for this moderating effect. Consequently, we cannot prove tenure to be a moderator of the relationship between commitment and the single success dimensions. Moreover, this relationship appears to be unmoderated. Accordingly, H3b cannot be confirmed at all. In H4, we hypothesized that satisfaction is only partially positively related to favorable user behavior. Satisfaction is not significantly related to content production. Viewing the model with loyalty and growth as dependent variables a positive and significant relation can be observed 0.348 with p ? 0.01 and 0.489 with p ? 0.01 Accordingly, satisfaction is positively related with the intention to remain in the community \(loyalty propensity to recommend the game to others \(growth However, regarding revenue as a dependent variable the coefficient of satisfaction is negatively significant 0.103 with p ? 0.05 with a clear causal effect. On the one hand, more satisfied users might tend to be less willing to pay for extra services or on the other hand it might be possible that payments to the community provider makes users unsatisfied. In all, H4 can only partially be confirmed  4. Conclusion  4.1. Discussion  This study set out to explore the influence of crossover between online and offline social networks membership tenure, satisfaction and commitment on favorable user behavior. As favorable user behavior we identified four major categories that drive community success: content \(creation of content by users willingness to pay for extra services loyalty \(intention to remain in the community growth \(propensity to recommend the community to other users online and offline networks would exhibit more favorable behavior than users with no cross-over. We further argued that a higher level of satisfaction with the community would lead to higher levels of favorable behavior. We also hypothesized that higher levels of commitment would lead to higher levels of favorable behavior. We further argued that the relationship Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 between commitment and favorable behavior would be moderated by membership tenure. Therefore, our study sheds light on the influence of user behavior on the success of online communities We found that the cross-over between online and offline social networks had a significant influence on three of the four user behaviors. Only loyalty was not influenced. This could be because in case of a crossover users can still be in touch with some of their online social network when they leave the community 


online social network when they leave the community and therefore do not loose all their ties. As predicted users who have been longer with the community display a higher level of satisfaction than new members. However, membership tenure had no influence on revenue, loyalty or growth. The reason might be that these three dimensions reflect users attitude towards the community which is, of course varying between different types of users and their behaviour but not depending on the time users have spent in the community. Furthermore, we found that satisfaction with the community had a negative influence on the willingness to pay and a positive effect on loyalty and recommendation behavior. No influence could be found on the creation of content This strengthens the argument that the creation of content is separated from the satisfaction with the community and more attached to the other users of the community. Moreover, this study shows that a high level of commitment had a significant impact on three of the four dimensions of favorable user behavior These results demonstrate the importance of a committed user base for the success of an online community. However, the hypotheses that the relationship between commitment and favorable behavior would be moderated by membership tenure could not be supported on any dimension. This is an opposite finding to previous research in other kind of communities [15] and therefore probably takes into account the special nature of a MMOG community Accordingly, commitment indeed influences community success but over time remains largely constant in a MMOG context Considering all the relationships in our framework we observe that all dimensions are influenced by user attributes. However, it should be noted that one of the most important success dimension from a provider?s point of view ? revenue ? was positively related to cross-over only and even negatively related to satisfaction These results bear several important implications for community providers. As we noted in the beginning of the paper, the drivers of a successful community are very hard to determine but there seems to be an overall agreement that the userbase and the underlying user characteristics play a major role. Therefore, favorable user behavior is crucial to the survival of the community. Most importantly we sought to highlight that it is not solely the volume of the userbase that makes a community successful, but, instead, the various attributes of the users within the userbase that drive different factors of success. Success in this context is a multi-faceted construct community providers have to have in mind when setting up and managing their community. Especially the commitment of the users should be fostered at any stage of their membership tenure to ensure that enough content is created within the community. Satisfaction with the community is another critical factor. However the relationship to favorable user behavior is ambivalent and therefore community providers must carefully balance the level of \(dis their platform. Moreover, community providers should encourage the cross-over of online and offline social networks by establishing incentives to pull ones offline friends into the online community. On the other hand community providers might seek to enhance pure online friends to real life contacts in order to increase the overlap between offline and online contacts  4.2. Limitations and future research  


Inevitably, this study has some limitations that have to be taken into account in order to adequately interpret the results and judge their generalizability. First, we employed self-reported measures for several key variables. In some cases \(e.g. willingness to pay sources of data were not available, but there was little reason to expect distortion in self-reporting. In some cases \(e.g. commitment and satisfaction are intrinsically subjective and perceptual; this condition necessitated the use of self-report [49 Second, we gathered data only in a single MMOG community and therefore, some effects could be unique to the specific design of the community Third, this study has been the first to examine different success factors of online communities, but cross-sectional in nature. To analyze the relation between the userbase and community success in greater detail, longitudinal studies using panel data could be of great value. Moreover, Partial Least Squares \(PLS an adequate technique Future research may build upon the results of this study in a number of ways. Extending this study to several MMOG communities and also in different countries could further deepen the understanding of determinants of favorable user behavior. Furthermore the role of membership tenure could be investigated in more detail to deepen our understandingof the user life cycle in a community and the different impact of users Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 characteristics and their behavior in various stages. The ambiguous relationship between favorable user behavior and the level of satisfaction seems particularly noteworthy. It was the only attribute to have both positive and negative relations with our success dimensions. Since most business models of MMOG communities are based on premium memberships, future research should explore the negative relationship between satisfaction and willingness to pay identified in this study more thoroughly In summary, the results of this study provide answers to the antecedents of favorable user behavior in online communities and provide insights into the diverse dimensions of success  5.
