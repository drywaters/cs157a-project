Application of SWAT model to Zhangweinan Canal sub-watershed  SU Baoli CAI Xitian, SUN Yongliang, XU Zongxue College of Water Sciences Beijing Normal University Beijing, 100875 P R China  Abstract 227Hydrological and water quality simulation faces big challenge because of intensive human activities in the Zhangweinan Canal sub-watershed of the Hai River basin. The Soil & Water Assessment Tools \(SWAT\modeling system was established depended on various of spatial and attribute data of this watershed, and parameters for hydrological, water quality and evapotranspiration \(ET\mulation were calibrated and verified using measured stream flow, water quality and remotesensing derived ET data, and different scenarios were simulated and analyzed. The results show that point source pollution 
contributed most of the pollutant loadings of pollutants in Zhangweinan sub-watershed, and non-point source pollution NPS\ contributes small and NPS pollutant losses are predominantly located in mountainous area Keywords- Soil and Water Assessment Tool \(SWAT\; non-point source pollution; scenario analysis; Zhangweinan sub-watershed I   I NTRODUCTION  The Zhangweinan Canal sub-watershed \(37,700 km 2  located in the southern part of the Hai River basin in Northern China Plain and is located between 112-118\260E longitude and 35\22639\260N latitude. The watershed terrain is high in western area and low in eastern area, which includes about 68% of the mountainous area and 32% of the plain area. The upstream locates in the Taihang Mountain, where most of the areas have elevation above 1000 m. Land use in the watershed includes 
53.4% agricultural land \(mainly rotation areas of winter wheat and summer maize, and rain-fed farmland\and 20.3% pasture area. There are many reservoirs and water gates in the upstream areas and downstream areas respectively, and the water consumption for irrigation, industrial and domestic water uses in this watershed are extremely complex, which made the hydrological and water quality simulation more complicated and being challenged Depended on large amount of data collection and in-situ investigation, this study applied SWAT model to simulate hydrological process and water quality process considering various water uses, point source pollution and non-point source pollution, and to conduct scenario analyses of pollution control and water quality management II  M ETHOD AND M ATERIALS

The main tributary Zhang River and Wei River concentrates near the Nantao hydrological 
station of the Guantao County, Hebei Province. Because the Zhangweinan Canal sub-watershed covers four provinces which including the Shanxi Province, the Henbei Province, the Henan Province and the Shandong Province \(mainly in downstream canal river catchment area\ the human activities inside watershed are extremely complicated and water use data are not known and shared completely among these four provinces, and the water rights conflicts happened sometimes in the past Sponsor: Hai Basin Integrated Water and Environment Management Project TF053183\ funded by Global Environmental Foundation.\(GEF Corresponding author: Dr SU Baolin \(1965-\, Associate professor, specialized in water environmental system analysis and non-point source pollution study Email: subl@bnu.edu.cn U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright

Water sources for top 5 and some other small irrigation areas are mainly from inside sub-watershed, and for some other irrigation areas in the Wei River catchment are also from the Yellow River. For example, some irrigation areas near the Xinxiang City of Henan Province draw water from main reach of the Yellow River through Gongchanzhuyi and ReminShengli Channel The general irrigation scheme in the rotation farmlands of winter wheat and summer maize are investigated and generalized in TABLE IV The investigations show that about 3~5 times of irrigation events are necessary during a rotation period of winter wheat and summer maize depending on precipitation and soil moisture conditions.

For example, Arnold et al 13 applied SWAT to simulate ET and calibrated using observed ET from conventional method. Immerzeel and Droogers  calibrated and verified ET simulated by SWAT using RS derived ET. Using RSderived ET to calibrate crop growth and ET parameters is a 


relatively new approach in recent SWAT model application and its key procedure is to determine suitable soil and crop growth parameters according to real growth process of the simulated crops 15  RS derived ET data with 1km-resolution, which was derived from ASTER/TM and AVHRR/MODIS data by the Institute of Remote Sensing and Application \(IRSA\ of CAS and using ETWatch model, was applied to calibrate and validate the monthly ET simulated by SWAT model. This RS derived data are verified using ground observed ET data by Expert Panel of GEF Hai River Basin Project and recommended for use in the Project. Please refer to reference   for details on ETWatch model and data set evaluation Depending on irrigation investigation and researches for rotation crops of winter wheat and summer maize, crop growth and ET parameters are calibrated and validated  Thereinto ET data of 11 typical sub-basins which covered fully by rotation crops of winter wheat and summer maize \(coded as land use class WWHT\ere averaged and compared with RSET Figure 2 The coefficient of determination R 2 d NashSutcliffe coefficient E NS reached 0.93 and 0.92 respectively It is shown that SWAT-simulated ET matches RS-ET well and represents growth cycle of winter wheat and summer maize  Figure 2  ET calibration and validation for rotation crops of winter wheat and summer maize \(WWHT B  Hydrograph Calibration & Validation The hydrological processes are calibrated and validated after ET calibration.

The parameter CANMX is not paid more attention in the previous studies, however, it is very important in semi-arid and arid areas, and its value should be determined based on land use classes. The calibration and validation of hydrological process was shown in Figure 3 The simulated hydrograph could basically match the observed ones and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of hydrological station Guantai Yuancun, Linqing and Xinji reached 0.61, 0.68, 0.81 and 0.81 during calibration period, and reached 0.47, 0.59, 0.75 and 0.77 during validation period, respectively.

Point source pollution is the main issue in Zhangweinan sub-watershed, especially in the Wei River tributary watershed The key task to improve water quality in the canal subwatershed is to assure that all point discharges can meet the discharge standards, and then pollution control focus can be switched to non-point source pollution control R EFERENCES   1  Neitsch S L, Arnold J G, Kiniry J R, et al.

Nevertheless, it must be noted at this point that because of the subjective nature of online trust, it is not possible to measure exactly how much trust is needed in a given scenario to ensure online privacy concerns do not arise  3.2.  The Locus of Control  The second concept that is part of online privacy is that of an individual?s locus of control.  The concept of locus of control was formulated by Julian Rotter in [35 and it refers to an individual?s generalized expectations concerning where control over future events in their life resides. ?Internal control? is the term used to describe the belief that control of future outcomes 


resides primarily in oneself while ?external control refers to the expectancy that control is outside of the individual, either in the hands of powerful others or due to fate or chance Individuals with an internal locus of control believe that they control their own destiny. They also believe that their own experiences are controlled by their own skill or efforts [54]. People who have an external locus of control tend to attribute their experiences to fate, chance, or luck. The situation is out of their control. These individuals generally do not learn from previous experience. Since they attribute both their successes and failures to luck or chance they tend to lack persistence and not have high levels of expectation [54 Generally, the formulation of locus of control stems from family, culture, and experience. Most so called internals have been shown to come from Figure 1 A model for online privacy  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 families that focused on effort, education, and responsibility. On the other hand, most externals come from families with a low socioeconomic status where there is a perceived lack of control over their lives [55  3.3 The Model Explained  In light of these facts, that each individual typically experiences varying levels of trusting behaviour and has varying expectations regarding the sources of control, figure 1 shows an interpretation of online privacy by way of a model. This model aims to highlight areas where privacy concerns arise so that measures can be taken to reduce them. The model represents  The process by which an individual strives to achieve their desired level of privacy  The influencing factors that impact upon the possibility of achieving the desired level of privacy, namely Online privacy concerns Trust in the behaviour of external bodies The need to feel in control Other needs, for example, the need to buy items online requires the individual to submit credit card details to a third party online The 5 step process outlined in figure 1 can be explained as follows  Individuals move between the four dimensions and functions of privacy, outlined by Westin, until they achieve their desired level of privacy \(1  They then encounter external factors from their environment, which impact on an individual?s ability to achieve their desired level of privacy, such as privacy concerns and the need to interact with 3rd parties. As a result, they settle on an acceptable level of privacy \(2  They take action to implement the acceptable level of privacy. The actions they take are heavily influenced by their propensity to trust and whether they have an internal or external locus of control. As a result, the personal actions differ from individual to individual \(3  They continue to take action until the achieved level of privacy equals the acceptable level of privacy \(4  They maintain that level of privacy until a new level is required due to internal and/or external changes and the process starts again \(5 


and the process starts again \(5 Drawing together these ideas, the following statements regarding the concept of online privacy must be outlined before the online privacy theory can be presented 1. Some degree of trust is a prerequisite for individuals to impart personal information online 2. Individuals need to feel in control of their personal space while online 3. A privacy theory should incorporate both concepts of trust and control in some manner if it is to describe accurately privacy in an online environment The next section outlines the privacy theory formulated by this research based on these statements  4. A Theory of Online Privacy  This section proposes a definition of online privacy based on the literature and then goes on to develop this definition into a theory of online privacy. Online privacy, from the perspective of the individual, is defined as follows Online Privacy is the continuous process of negotiating, with relevant third parties, an optimum or acceptable level of disclosure of personal information in an online environment This process involves a form of trusting behaviour on the part of the individual and encompasses both access to and use of their personal information In light of this definition, the concept of online privacy can be seen as a subjective decision-making process which necessitates negotiation with third parties for the continuous protection of personal information. Additionally, the optimum or acceptable level of online privacy for a given individual is greatly influenced by the individual's personal characteristics and pressures from their external environment. The principal pressures upon an individual from their external environment are  The quantity and reliability of the information that is available to the individual about the security of any personal information that they may have imparted online and the use to which that information may be put  The strength of the desire of the individual to obtain the goods, services or information provided by a third party The dominating personal characteristics influencing an individual?s optimal level of online privacy are  Whether the individual has an internal or external locus of control. Individuals with an internal locus of control would have more of a need for the provision of online privacy guarantees such as privacy seals and privacy policies. Such individuals need to feel they are in control before they feel comfortable with imparting their personal information online. Individuals with an external locus of control would have less of a need for such provisions Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5  An individual's propensity to trust online third parties. Individuals with a high propensity to trust have a lesser need for privacy guarantees Inversely, individuals with a low propensity to trust have a greater need for privacy guarantees and for provision of information regarding the use of their personal information  4.1. Conceptualising Online Privacy  


 The need for online privacy arises when individuals decide upon a level of social or commercial interaction that they desire from an online experience. They then take measures to reach this level.  As seen from Westin?s theory, there are four states of privacy within which an individual moves. These states of privacy are applicable not only in a physical space, but also in a virtual space Solitude, in an online context, translates into the desire of the individual to ensure that their actions and movements are not monitored while online. Goodwin in 13] argues that individuals often seek such solitude when purchasing items either online or offline for three main reasons. The first reason is to enhance the quality of the consumption experience. The second is to avoid interference from disapproving reference groups and the third is to avoid the discomfort associated with selfdiscrepancy. She argues that while it is widely accepted that public displays of possessions communicate information about oneself, concealment can also help an individual achieve self-presentational goals. By achieving consumer solitude, the individual can maintain his or her presented self to specific audiences while experimenting with consumption behaviours to express a variety of possible selves The state of intimacy over the Internet means that being secluded in small online groups allows for the fostering of close relationships within those groups These small online groups can exist in various guises over the Internet. For example, social networking sites blogs and newsgroups allow for users to experience intimacy while online by being a member of a small group or community The state of Internet anonymity means freedom from identification and from surveillance or observation of any kind [56]. This is the state of privacy that allows individuals to be able to browse the Internet with a considerable amount of identity protection. Internet anonymity is not absolute. That is, the degree of anonymity one enjoys may vary. However, through a combination of public-key encryption and special anonymous remailer computers, messages can be sent over the Internet with a high degree of certainty that they cannot be traced to their originator [57 Additionally, individuals can use cyber cafes as well as a variety of more sophisticated \(and some illegal techniques to remain anonymous online Reserve over the Internet encompasses actions such as an individual restricting the circulation of their email address to close friends in order to avoid unwanted advertising emails and spam. Additionally individuals are entitled to expect that propagation of their sensitive information, such as their financial or health information is limited and controlled. However not only information that is deemed private by society should be protected. Individuals have the right to determine what they consider their private information to be Even though an individual has a desired privacy state, they will sometimes need to accept a less than desirable state of privacy in order to interact in that environment. This is due to the influences of factors in the external environment which are outside of the individual?s control. This less than desirable state of privacy is defined as the optimal or acceptable level of privacy that is achievable in a given external environment Once the optimal level of privacy has been decided upon by the individual, they can then carry out a series of actions to ensure it is achieved. For example, an 


of actions to ensure it is achieved. For example, an individual may wish to remain anonymous while on the Internet, but over time the desire to buy an item online becomes stronger than remaining anonymous Therefore, the individual carries out a series of preliminary actions to assess the risks involved in submitting their personal information \(such as credit card details asking friends how safe it is to buy online, or checking the privacy policies of the vendor website to ensure the site safeguards personal information. Once individuals have assessed the online environment and the perceived risks involved, there are two choices available to them. They can decide that the need to buy online outweighs the perception of the risk of submitting their personal information, or they can decide to remain anonymous and forego the purchase Individual choose the actions that bring them closest to their optimal level of privacy It is important to mention at this point that the desired level of online privacy is a non-monotonic function similar to Altman?s description of the traditional concept of privacy. That is to say that complete online privacy is not necessarily the optimal solution. It is possible for an individual to experience too much or too little online privacy. When there is too much online privacy \(actual &gt; desired level may be deprived of the opportunity to interact online On the other hand, when there is too little privacy desired &gt; actual level Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 more online solitude. The goal of this research is to obtain the optimal level of privacy for every individual at all times. The next subsection gives examples of how this research can be used to achieve that goal  4.2. Application of the Theory  As stated in the previous section, the ultimate aim of this research is to obtain the optimal level of privacy for every individual at all times. In order to achieve this goal, this research suggests giving control of an individual?s privacy back to the individual. In doing so the individual?s personal privacy preferences will determine the level of online privacy they experience One possibility which would give control back to the user would be to build a privacy slider application into web browsers which would allow the individual to specify their desired level of online privacy before going online.  The slider could contain four privacy levels. These levels correspond to the states of privacy outlined in Westin?s theory Choosing the solitude level on the privacy slider, the first of Westin?s privacy states, would translate into the desire of the individual to prevent people they know offline from finding out their actions and movements online. By selecting online solitude, the individual maintains his or her offline self to offline audiences while experimenting with various online behaviours The level of intimacy on the privacy slider corresponding to the second of Westin?s privacy states allows a select number of other users to see when the user is online. Being secluded in small online groups allows for the fostering of close relationships within those groups, while being invisible to the outside online world by blocking tracking applications and cookies If the user chooses the anonymous level, the third of Westin?s states, they will be able to browse the Internet with a considerable amount of identity protection as the user?s IP address will be withheld. Additionally, the privacy slider, when set to this level, will block any 


privacy slider, when set to this level, will block any attempts by websites to track the user?s online movements or to download any cookies onto the user?s machine The reserve level of the privacy slider, the fourth of Westin?s privacy states, restricts the possibility of identifying the user to a specified list of ?trusted websites. If an unknown website seeks the user?s identification, a warning message will appear reminding the user that the website is not a trusted site Additionally, cookies and tracking applications will be blocked for all but trusted sites. This allows an individual to restrict the circulation of their personal information to trusted third parties Individuals can specify, from a list within the slider application, what they consider their private information to be and therefore what information to protect In order to ensure a user?s desired state of privacy is achievable while interacting online, users must continuously assess the online environment and take necessary action. The privacy slider could aid the user in achieving their desired level of privacy by continually monitoring the online situation and the user?s actions. It could use dynamic privacy policies and privacy policy agents to adjust and readjust a user?s privacy needs for the duration of their time online. If the user?s desired level of privacy is not possible as a result of the need to interact with online third parties, the privacy agents negotiate an ?optimal level of privacy \(see figure 1 prompting the user for the best course of action to take in the form of privacy messages and warnings. This allows the user to set their privacy according to their propensity to trust and the level of control they need in order to feel comfortable about their online privacy The World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C  set up a project called the Platform for Privacy Preferences \(P3P that allows the encoding of human-readable privacy policies into machine-readable XML. This specification could be used to develop the privacy slider application The privacy slider could have two main functions Primarily, it could activate privacy policy agents which compare the user?s desired level of privacy solitude, intimacy, reserve or anonymity website?s XML privacy policy, \(however, a limitation of this is that not all websites have XML privacy policies Secondly, the privacy application has functionality that acts in much the same way as a reputation system The user has the ability to independently rate their experiences, by answering a series of questions with regard to how trustworthy they perceive the website to be and how they feel their private information is handled by the website A type of collaborative filtering algorithm could then determine ratings for the website in question These privacy reputation ratings could be stored in an independent database. However, a limitation of this scenario is that it would take time for websites to build up their privacy reputations and also it is not clear where the independent database could be stored Whenever the user re-visits the website in question, their privacy slider application would check not only the websites XML privacy policy but also this reputation rating and verify it was equal to or above the privacy requirements of the user. If the privacy reputation rating was below the user?s privacy requirements then a conflict would occur and the user Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 


7 would be notified immediately.  In this situation, the user could decide to ignore the privacy warning and continue interacting with the website or they could choose to disengage from the privacy negotiations and move onto another website. Such a system might also avail of independent agent information such as reliability ratings \(cf. eBay design such machine interfaces in a way that minimalizes the requirement for user intervention and in a similar manner to current spam filters, such a system could learn over time to ?know? its user?s preferences The conclusion discusses the contributions and the future work of this research  5. Conclusions and Future Work  The next step in this research is to validate the privacy control theory. This will be achieved by carrying out a series of non-participant observation sessions over a six month period. The sessions will be carried out by observing computer literate individuals while they spend time online. Each session will last for one hour and each participant will be observed for a minimum of 10 hours over the six month period. The participants will be a representative mix of male and female Irish adults of various ages The overall objectives of this research are twofold Firstly, it seeks to develop, through the use of an online privacy model, a theory of online privacy that reflects adequate privacy needs in all online experiences Secondly, once a theory of privacy has been satisfactorily defined and validated, it can be used to form the basis for the design of an interface between the user and the Internet The importance of this research lies, firstly in defining the concepts of online privacy which in turn contributes towards determining an individual?s privacy needs in the digital world. Secondly, it lies in contributing towards preventing privacy abuses to that individual once they have divulged private information online. If the latter is achieved, this research will have contributed towards regaining control of the online privacy of not only adults but also of the most cherished and most vulnerable in society, children  References  1] CBS News, "Laptop with bank details of over a million Britons sold on eBay," vol. 2008: CBS News, 2008 pp. http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2008/08/26/ebaybritain.html 2] Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, "A Chronology of Data Breaches," vol. 2008.

the packets, and one quarter-second later, three packets of size 512 bytes are sent, followed one-quarter second later by one packet of size 256 bytes The accumulated bytes sent with respect to time in seconds are shown in Figure 17 Total Bytes Seconds Figure 17: Accumulated bytes for the example pattern The packets described above have been inserted into a set of network trac packet collected from the author?s laptop over roughly 4 minutes of usage starting at w = 240 seconds. The total accumulated outgoing bytes are illustrated in Figure 18. To apply the basis looking for this specic pattern, we Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 accumulate the bytes on quarter-second intervals and generate a wavelet decomposition for a sliding 4-second window, which is compared to the original pattern?s decomposition with the UPVH. The UPVH for the dierent starting times are shown in Figure 19. Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time Total Bytes Seconds Figure 18: Accumulated outgoing bytes of a sample usage period plus the packets in our pattern UPVH Seconds Figure 19: UPVH values \(less than 50 blocks of data with digerent starting times Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time In fairness, this method of nding patterns has many of the same weaknesses found in other signature-matching approaches. The pattern has to be known ahead of time, which means that this detection scheme would still be vulnerable to rst-time attacks. Also, a completely innocuous data ow occurring with very similiar timing and quantities as our pattern will still cause a low UPVH value, possibly causing a false-positive alert. We do claim 


however, that we have a greater capacity for nding patterns in quantiable amounts that are obscured by standard network trac. Also, we can adjust the sensitivity of the search without changing the signature for which we are searching, by adjusting the threshold of the UPVH?s for which an alert is issued. Thus, statistical techniques and adaptive learning can be used to help develop optimal threshold levels for a particular pattern 4. Conclusion Wavelet analysis holds an as-of-yet untapped potential for analyzing usage patterns in network trac ows, due to their ability to lter out data up to a given approximation order. Neither simple character searches nor Fourier analysis has this capability. Also, while Fourier analysis generally gives only frequency information within an analysis window, wavelet analysis gives some amount of both frequency information and the location of that frequency activity. The additional information comes at no additional computational costs, since the bases are generally applied by convolving matrix lters over the data \(repeated matrix multiplication over sliding blocks of data tiwavelet bases introduced in this document should prove to be particularly useful in pattern-matching applications, due to their short support \(that is, non-zero only over a small interval the inclusion of splines in the approximation spaces instead of just polynomials, and the ability to use them on time series with left and right boundaries The author is currently working with computer scientists at the CyberDefense Lab \(CDL at Western Kentucky University to develop software that will utilize these bases in network security, intrusion-detection, and data-extrusion applications. Once developed, we will study the eectiveness of this type of analysis in detecting malicious behavior as compared to the more commonly used techniques, with the hope of improving detection capabilities while maintaining a low false-positive rate. The software will initially be tested in the CDL?s sandbox while running attacks from its attack library with various background usage scripts being implemented, but will eventually move to less controlled network environments Acknowledments: This work supported in part by the NACMAST consortium under contract

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
