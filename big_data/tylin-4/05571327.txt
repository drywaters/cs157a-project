Interaction with computers using mobile devices Mariko Sasakura 003  Shinsuke Fujioka 003 and Susumu Yamasaki 003 003 Computer Science Department Okayama University Okayama Japan Email sasakura@momo.cs.okayama-u.ac.jp Abstract We propose a new interaction way that uses mobile devices to input and output devices of computers The idea is simple but powerful because 1 mobile devices are popular 2 people can use them easily 3 people carry them at all times 4 two displays one of which is a big display for 
a computer and another is a small display of a mobile device may make new interaction and visualization and 5 a user can store parts of public data in physically independent device that is his/her mobile device We expect that our idea may make psychological barrier lower than now so that users can access and modify all data around the world more easily In this paper we show an example application based the idea we propose and discuss its possibilities Keywords Mobile devices Focus  Context Post-WIMP interface Ubiquitous computing Data personalization Pocketing data I I 
NTRODUCTION Most people today have their own mobile phones Current mobile phones are actually small computers They have enough computing power to send e-mails show web pages play games and so on Mobile phones are the most familiar computers to us In contrast personal computers are still considered dif\002cult to use Since there are many useful applications running on personal computers making really good ways to use personal computers may be pro\002table Strangely however many people are afraid to use personal computers even though they fully utilize their mobile phones which have almost the same ability as personal computers 
Our idea is to use a mobile device as the input and output device of a personal computer By making use of a familiar device that is a mobile phone people may 002nd it much easier to use a personal computer In addition we think that mobile devices for input and output may provide a new human computer path We expect that the advantages of our idea are 1 Most people have their own mobile devices There is no need to buy a mobile device for a proposed system 2 The proposed system is easy-to-use because users can use their favorite mobile devices 3 Since users carry around their mobile devices at any 
time they can use the proposed system everywhere 4 To use two displays physically which are a display for a personal computer and a display of a mobile device may allow users easy to recognize the difference of data displayed in the personal computer display and the mobile device display It may make new interaction and visualization methods 5 Users can store parts of public data in their mobile devices They can be the owner of the data We call it as pocketing data  They can browse investigate or modify the pocketed data freely without any distur 
bance because the pocketed data is stored in their mobile devices locally We expect that our system may make psychological barrier to use computers lower than now so that users can access and modify all data around the world more easily In a way pocketing data we mentioned in 5 is already achieved by the World Wide Web In the Web users can access data around the world by their mobile devices However the Web is closed in electronic virtual world We think that it is possible for the users to interact both of the virtual and real world by using mobile devices Our idea may contribute it In Section II we set out our requirements and problems 
clearly In Section III we explain how we have solved the problems mentioned in Section II and show an example application which uses the interaction we propose The logical aspects of the proposed interaction are mentioned in Section IV Our discussion is in Section V and conclusions in Section VI II S YSTEM S PECIFICATION A Architecture Our idea is to use mobile devices as input and output devices of personal computers Figure 1 shows the architecture which realizes our idea There are several computers and mobile devices Personal computers and mobile devices which 
have sharable data can communicate with any computers or mobile devices in a local network Mobile devices which do not have sharable data can communicate with computers or mobile devices which have sharable data Two personal computers and one mobile device in Figure 1 have sharable data In this architecture data in a personal computer can be shared The computer sends data to mobile devices when they request it The computer receives data from the mobile devices when they send it All data 003ows are controlled

by the mobile devices The computers are passive This architecture means that we use mobile devices as both the input and the output devices of computers Each mobile device can request computers to send data modify the data and resend the data to the computers We assume that the mobile devices keep data temporarily and send back the data to the computer if necessary We can consider this ability of the mobile devices as a function application B Technical Problems To realize our idea shown in Figure 1 two problems must be solved 1 How do machines personal computers and mobile devices communicate with each other In terms of convenience the most important point is that we can put mobile devices in the network of our system without special operations If someone goes to a room in which our system is running his/her mobile device can join our network without any operation We have to 002nd the way to achieve this environment 2 How do we design interaction with mobile devices For example how does a mobile device specify the machine to connect to We would like to design intuitive interaction for our system Some mobile devices have acceleration sensors so that we can use them to achieve intuitive interaction We describe our ideas for solving these problems in the next section III S YSTEM I MPLEMENTATION A Communication between machines To solve problem 1 mentioned in Section II we use Bonjour as the communication protocol which is a zerocon\002guration networking Bonjour 1 is developed by Apple Inc for Mac OS X and Windows Therefore only machines which use Bonjour can use our system The salient characteristic of Bonjour is that there is no server machine but all machines in a subnet broadcast their services Without any registration action a machine in the subnet searches the available service by itself Therefore we can construct a system which satis\002es the condition we mentioned in Section II In our system all personal computers and certain mobile devices whose data we would like to share with other mobile devices are registered to sharing the data machine service Certain operations are needed to register the service However for most mobile devices which don't share their data with other devices no operations for receiving and sending data to/with other computers are needed 1 http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa Conceptual/NetServices/Introduction.html B Interaction For intuitive interaction we plan to use acceleration sensors in mobile devices We interpret movement of a mobile device as input for personal computers For example if we wave a mobile device back and forth or tip it a computer interprets the movement as some command In an example application reported in this paper we plan to implement the function which selects a machine to be connected by the movement of a mobile device but we have not yet implemented it A machine to be connected is selected by a menu in the example application What we can do however is select which part of an image to get from a personal computer to a mobile device by movement of the mobile device We can zoom the image up or down by using a touch panel or buttons on the mobile device C An example application We have developed an example application which can send one part of an image from a machine a personal computer or a mobile device to another mobile device and zoom it up and down in the mobile device The example application consists of several personal computers and several mobile devices These machines must be supported by Bonjour and the mobile devices must have acceleration sensors Therefore we use Mac PC as a personal computer and iPod touch or iPhone as a mobile device We have developed an example application which can send and receive images between a personal computer and a mobile device or between a mobile device and another mobile device The functions of personal computers and mobile devices are as follows The functions of personal computers 017 A personal computer can capture a current desktop image and send part of it to mobile devices if a mobile device requests the image 017 A personal computer can receive an image from a mobile device and put it on the current desktop image if the mobile device sends the image to the computer The functions of mobile devices 017 A mobile device can select the partner of the connection that is a personal computer or a mobile device In the current test system the selection is done by selecting a button with the machine's name In future we would like to design a more intuitive interaction way 017 A mobile device can specify the part of the desktop image of a personal computer by acceleration sensors and receive that part of the image 017 A mobile device can send or receive one part of the original image to/from another mobile device 017 A mobile device can modify the received image In the current test system we can only add a new line to the image In future we would like to develop other

V D ISCUSSION The studies of interaction using mobile devices especially iPhone or iPod touch are among those of post-WIMP Window Icon Menu Pointing device interfaces 4  Our study is another one of them The feature of our study is that we propose a system which uses a combination of personal computers and mobile devices From the point of view of information visualization the proposed system is an application of the focus+context method 5 Most focus+conte xt methods present an overview impression and detailed information in the same image but some represent them in different windows on the same display Our proposed system can show them in different displays on a personal computer and on a mobile device or on different mobile devices We can consider the proposed system as a new method of focus  context With this method we hope to decrease mental gaps of users who deal with information at different levels of abstraction but we have not veri\002ed the effect yet This is work for the future As we mentioned in Section IV the example application we developed is an application of distributed lambda calculus which is a model of concurrent systems 031 calculus is a popular model of concurrent 9 There are some studies on models of concurrent process based on 025 calculus 6 7 The 025 calculus is a model based on functions In our developed system consists of distributed environments which can apply functions to data personal computers and mobile devices We can regard the system as a realistic model of concurrent process VI C ONCLUSIONS We propose a new interaction method that uses mobile devices for input and output to/from computers We present an example application we developed and show the possibility of our method We expect to decrease mental gaps of users who deal with information at different levels of abstraction by using physically-separated devices We think the advantages of this system are 017 A user can access a personal computer by his/her favorite mobile device instead of a keyboard and mouse 017 He/she can use a touch panel and/or acceleration sensors if the mobile device has them The touch panel and/or acceleration sensors may provide intuitive interaction 017 A user can get a distributed environment easily since the system sends data from a personal computer to a mobile device if the mobile device requests them In the environment the user can carry the data by the mobile device or divide data editing work among several persons In the application we introduced in this paper we can use a touch panel and movements of a mobile device for interaction Now we are developing other version which use tilting a mobile device for interaction Applications we are planning to develop are 1 Presentation system In the system a user who is a listener of a presentation can see the slide by his/her mobile device zoom up an arbitrary part of the slide and read supplemental explanations prepared by the presenter at any time 2 Computer supported co-operative work system This system provides big physical electronic bulletin board to which members can access The members can get data displayed on the bulletin board and modify the data on their mobile device and send the modi\002ed data to the bulletin board The data on the bulletin board are updated when it receives the data from the mobile devices 3 3D visualizer system In this system a user can see a surface appearance of a 3D graphical object in a display of a personal computer If the user speci\002es a cross-section surface by a mobile device the image of the inside of the object is displayed on the mobile device If the user uses several mobile devices he/she can see several cross-section surface and the surface appearance of the object at the same time The next problems we have to solve are 017 To check that processing speed amount of memories and transfer speed of mobile devices are enough or not for our applications 017 To examine which movements can be recognized by acceleration sensors of mobile devices and to design interaction commands by using the movements R EFERENCES  Bednarz T P  Caris C and Drang a O Human-computer interaction

environment in a country significantly affected ecommerce activities and revenues in that country [9 38, 39].  A group of firm-level survey studies also showed that the regulatory environment was significantly important to determine both the breadth and depth of e-business adoption, especially in developing countries and newly industrialized economies [40-44].  A study of SMEs? e-commerce adoption in the APEC region further specified that an adequate legal framework supporting e-commerce was important for reducing uncertainties and building trust and confidence in the electronic marketplace; it was particularly important for lower GDP economies [20 Overall, the legal environment should be secure, stable and predictable for e-commerce adoption Unfortunately, the development of the legal framework for e-commerce was generally well behind developments in technology, and thus conducting business through the electronic networks raised numerous legal questions [20].  The key legal challenges could be found in different stages of ecommerce transaction 1 data and intellectual property protection of digital content 2 electronic contract and digital signature and security of online transaction; and 3 jurisdiction, validity of electronic evidence, and enforceability of court orders Absences of regulations and legislations were a major barrier and/or serious limitation to e-commerce adoption in the APEC region, Oman, Turkey, and UK 20, 33, 45, 46].  A study shows that e-commerce adoption was slow in the countries without adequate legal framework regulating rights and obligations in the intangible cyberspace [8].  For example, compared with the U.S., fewer firms in China adopted ecommerce due to the less friendly legal environment 8].  By contrast, the US legal environment was more supportive of e-commerce than in other countries.  It led to a higher percentage of US firms using ecommerce [8].  A related study confirmed that the U.S did have a better legal environment supporting ecommerce use than other countries and that US companies expressed fewer legal concerns when doing e-commerce [47].  On the other hand, APEC?s study on e-commerce adoption found that firms in lower GDP countries appeared to be more concerned about legal issues than similar firms in higher GDP countries [20 This concern might be due, in part, to a relative lack of adequate legal infrastructure for e-commerce in those lower GDP countries.  This issue was further reflected in Wang?s study in which he found that regulatory reform was critical for IT adoption in developing and newly industrialized economies [19 Several studies have developed theoretical arguments as to the best practices for regulating ecommerce.  They discussed numerous issues from legal frameworks to legislating efforts with respect to e-commerce [48-51].  In the real world, legal systems have tried to re-orient themselves to suit the needs of dynamic development and changes of e-commerce Since the Model Law on Electronic Commerce drafted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law \(UNCITRAL countries and regions have passed and implemented various legislations and regulations related to ecommerce [52].  Many international and regional organizations, including the World Trade Organization WTO ICC 


WTO ICC Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD EU Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation \(APEC been actively involved in policy-making for global ecommerce development The legal consideration was the root of traditional institutional theory.  Institutions were first the legal ground rules and procedures.  Institutional influences were therefore political in nature as when members in the society must conform to laws and regulations to earn the legitimacy [14, 15].  The legal institution should provide predictable, credible, coherent and adaptable rules for economic transactions.  Among those criteria, adaptability is particularly necessary because it helps ensure that the changes in social preferences, technology and other external factors can be accommodated by institutional structures [12 Accordingly, new institutionalism believed that the legal environment should reduce uncertainty by providing adequate, clear and efficient frameworks for economic change [14 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 Drawing on both theoretical and empirical assertions, this study hypothesized that an adequate adaptable and supportive legal environment could have a positive impact on e-commerce adoption, as follows H2: The more adequate/supportive is the legal environment, the more prevalent is e-commerce adoption in the country  4. Research methodology  4.1. Use of secondary data  The data collected by other research institutions government agencies or international bodies are called secondary data? or ?archival data?.  Secondary data analysis is especially appropriate for studies that cover large numbers of countries over time [53].  Some scholars argued that the intelligent use of secondary data sets plays a significant role in the development of research continuity and the accumulation of knowledge in IS research [54].  Furthermore, since the secondary data have been collected by a different organization the analyst has only minimal impact on the data collection process and thus has minimal researcher bias in the analysis [55].  Given the advantages provided by secondary analysis, there were several calls for employing secondary data in IS research [55, 56 However, it is still rare so far in IT adoption literature This study used secondary data collected and compiled by the UK-based Economist Intelligence Unit, a well-respected international research and advisory institution, to study e-commerce adoption across a number of countries and at two time points The EIU has published an annual e-readiness ranking since 2000.  A country?s e-readiness is essentially a set of measures of its e-business environment \(including business, legal, policy and culture environments which is conductive to its e-business adoption.  The earliest available data were in 2003 and the latest data were in 2007.  Based on a series of secondary data analyses conducted in this study, institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its related hypotheses were tested Technically speaking, the concept of the institutional environment was difficult to measure directly in every country.  Therefore, e-readiness rankings in the EIU?s report were composite scores from aggregating scores in six distinct categories, and 


from aggregating scores in six distinct categories, and these six categories in turn were aggregated scores of nearly 100 quantitative and qualitative observable criteria.  The majority of original data were sourced from the EIU?s regularly calculated Country Forecasts Those national forecast indicators were scored on a scale from 1 to 10, reflecting qualitative assessments by the EIU?s extensive network of country analysts and reviewed by the EIU?s top economist team [25, 57  4.2. Multi-time point approach  Unlike most cross-sectional analyses that took place at a single point in time, this study involved a series of data collections and measurements at multiple points in time.  Phase-I of the data collection occurred in 2003.  It represented the early stage of e-commerce adoption?governments around the world began to take e-commerce into account in formatting economic policies.  Phase-II of the data collection occurred in 2007.  The data represented a snapshot of the latest development of e-commerce and its institutional environment.  The investigation repeated the secondary analysis in Phase-II to test the same \(or similar hypotheses as in Phase-I.  It was particularly important and interesting to see whether there were different effects of the legal and policy environments on ecommerce adoption at its beginning stage and when ecommerce model was becoming prevalent and routine This temporal approach to observe change of those institutional influences over time provides a better basis for causal inference than a single cross-sectional study does [58].  It also enhanced the comprehension and explanation of the institutional circumstances that affected e-commerce adoption  4.3. Sample  4.3.1. Phase-I \(2003 secondary data analysis at Phase-I, this study used the EIU E-readiness Rankings of 2003 and there were 60 countries \(N1=60 covered the world?s 60 largest economies, which accounted for 95% of global GDP [57].Third-order headings, as in this paragraph, are discouraged However, if you must use them, use 10-point Times boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, followed by a period and your text on the same line  4.3.2.

However, the variables in the rankings have been continuously updated and refined from year to year.  This was because of the dynamism of the IT developments and the need to review the appropriate set of variables in good time in order to improve the data quality.  The revisions also made the new sets of variables used in the Phase-II analyses better match the research model than the ones used in Phase I Specifically speaking, the legal environment category \(LE focused look at the specific regulatory frameworks that influence e-adoption [59].  As a reflection of its greater emphasis on the role of governments in fostering ebusiness, the EIU isolated the effect of government policy from the original category of ?legal and policy environment? and created its own category government policy and vision? \(GP process of refinement was undertaken by the EIU analyst panel led by the director of global technology research.  All assessments were, in turn, reviewed by the EIU?s senior economist team [59].  Accordingly there were two IVs at Phase-II: LE and GP.  The DV and two CVs remained the same at Phase II: CBA, SCI and GDPPP \(all reflecting new scores in 2007  5. Data analyses and results  5.1.

Discussion and conclusion  6.1. Discussion of findings  The secondary data analyses in this study were able to demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between the institutional environment and e-commerce adoption.  Specifically speaking, the legal and policy environment did exert a substantial positive impact on e-commerce adoption around the world at the early stage of e-commerce \(the worldwide average score of e-commerce was only 5.51 out of 10 in the EIU 2003 sample government financial support of e-commerce and related infrastructure projects, effectiveness of legal framework, and laws covering e-commerce, together they fostered consumers and businesses in many countries to engage in e-commerce in 2003.  This finding proved the institutional perspective about the critical role of government policy and legal environment in driving e-commerce adoption Four years later, in 2007, the global average score of e-commerce improved from 5.51 to 6.37, at a rate of 16%.  As e-commerce became more prevalent in the world, supportive government policy still provided a powerful explanation for variations in e-commerce adoption around the world.  On the other hand, the impact of legal environment was reduced.  A possible explanation from the perspective of institutionalism is that a predictive and effective legal environment was important to reduce the institutional uncertainty and ensure the trust and confidence in e-commerce activities, especially during the initial stage of ecommerce development.  A good legal system is a safeguard for online commercial transactions Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal 


Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
