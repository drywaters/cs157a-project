Language Models  Topic Models for Personalizing Tag Recommendation Ralf Krestel L3S Research Center Hannover Germany Email krestel@l3s.de Peter Fankhauser Fraunhofer IPSI Darmstadt Germany Email fankhauser@ipsi.fraunhofer.de Abstract More and more content on the Web is generated by users To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords tags which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval To support 
the user in choosing the right keywords tag recommendation algorithms have emerged In this setting not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the userês preferences In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation and our approach signiìcantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches Keywords Personalization Data mining Clustering I I 
NTRODUCTION The World Wide Web is growing at incredible speed User generated content is uploaded by millions everyday Web 2.0 or the Social Web are evolving rapidly Sharing of user generated content is one of the predominant actions on the Web nowadays To organize this content and to make it accessible to other users is the main purpose of sites like Flickr 1  LastFm 2  YouTube 3  or Delicious 4  These sites allow users to annotate content with their own keywords tags opening up the possibility to retrieve content using traditional keyword search Especially multimedia 
content like music photos or videos rely on manually added meta information Adding keywords to content tagging is the only feasible way to organize multimedia data at that scale and to make it searchable These keywords can be freely chosen by a user and are not restricted to any taxonomy This results in some beneìts like exibility quick adaption and easy usability but has also some drawbacks Tagging is considered a categorization process not a classiìcation process  1  The underlying meaning has to be e v aluated and inferred in the context of other tags and user information 1 Flickr http://www.îickr.com 2 LastFm 
http://www.last.fm 3 YouTube http://www.youtube.com 4 Delicious http://delicious.com Tags can even have no concrete meaning or are only interpretable by the user herself In addition tags can have various purposes Some describe the annotated content some refer to the user e.g jazz myHolidays or to read  2  In practice allowing users to freely annotate means that tagging systems contain noise and are rather sparsely populated Studies  3   4  ha v e sho wn that man y users annotating a 
resource leads to a stable tag distribution for this resource capturing its characteristics sufìciently To support users in choosing tags tag recommendation algorithms have emerged For resources already annotated by lots of people this recommendation is rather straight forward The tagging system can provide the most frequent tags assigned to the resource or look at the tagging history of the user to make a more personalized recommendation On this note tag recommendation algorithms can be classiìed into user-centered and resourcecentered ones  5  In this paper we combine both perspectives to recommend personalized tags to users To this end we employ a mixture Section III-D 
 of simple language models LM Section III-B  and Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA Section III-C  to estimate the probability of new tags based on the already assigned tags of a resource and a user and introduce a principled approach for combining these estimates in Section III-A  The potential advantage of employing LDA is the possibility to recommend tags not previously assigned to the resource or used by the user This broadens the available vocabulary for tag recommendation The potential advantage of combining the resource perspective with the user perspective is to lter general tags for a resource with the individual 
tagging preferences of a user In Section IV we evaluate our approach on a real world dataset We systematically analyze tag recommendation based on resources or users only assess the possible merits of LDA as opposed to language models and compare our combined approach to FolkRank  6  as a state-of-the-art personalized tag-recommender Our evaluation shows that combining evidence from the resource and the user improves tag recommendation signiìcantly and that LDA helps in particular for generalizing from individual tagging practices on resources Moreover our approach achieves signiìcantly better accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches

II R ELATED W ORK In recent years interest in tag recommendation was sparked within the research community The gaining importance of tagging systems led to the development of sophisticated tag recommendation algorithms A popular approach to this end has been Collaborative Filtering a well known approach for different kinds of recommender systems  7  Xu et al  8  describe a w ay to recommend a fe w descripti v e tags to users by rewarding co-occuring tags that have been assigned by the same user penalizing co-occuring tags that have been assigned by different users and boosting tags with high descriptiveness An interactive approach in the context of a photo tagging site based on co-occurence is presented in  9  After the user enters a tag for a new resource the algorithm recommends tags based on co-occurence of tags for resources which the user or others used together in the past After each tag the user assigns or selects the set is narrowed down to make the tags more speciìc Sigurbj  ornsson and van Zwol  10  also look at co-occurence of tags to recommend tags based on a user deìned set of tags The co-occuring tags are then ranked and promoted based on e.g descriptiveness Jaeschke et al  11  compare tw o v ariants of collaborative ltering and FolkRank  6  a graph based algorithm for recommendations in folksonomies For collaborative ltering once the similarity between users on tags and once the similarity between users on resources is used for recommendation FolkRank uses random walk techniques on the userresource-tag URT graph based on the idea that popular users resources and tags can reinforce each other These algorithms take co-occurrence of tags into account only indirectly via the URT graph Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves signiìcantly better accuracy than FolkRank and even the simple and scalable combination of smoothed language models achieves competitive accuracy Symeonidis et al  12  emplo y dimensionality reduction to personalized tag recommendation Whereas  11  operate on the URT graph directly  12  use generalized techniques of SVD Singular Value Decomposition for n-dimensional tensors The 3-dimensional tensor corresponding to the URT graph is unfolded into 3 matrices which are reduced by means of SVD individually and combined again to arrive at a more dense URT tensor approximating the original graph The algorithm then suggests tags to users if their weight is above some threshold Rendle and Schmidt-Thieme  13  introduce two more efìcient variants of this approach using canonical decomposition and pairwise interaction tensor factorization When content of resources is available tag recommendation can also be approached as a classiìcation problem predicting tags from content A recent approach in this direction is presented in  14  The y cluster the document-term-tag matrix after an approximate dimensionality reduction and obtain a ranked membership of tags to clusters Tags for new resources are recommended by classifying the resources into clusters and ranking the cluster tags accordingly Heymann et al  15  emplo y association rule mining on the tag sets of resources for collective tag recommendation The mined association rules have the form T 1 002 T 2  where T 1 and T 2 are tag sets On this basis tags in T 2 are recommended when all tags in T 1 are available for the resource and the conìdence for the association rules is above a threshold In  16  we ha v e sho wn that tag recommendation based on LDA achieves signiìcantly better accuracy than this approach and recommends more speciìc tags which are more useful for tag-based search A LDA for Tag Recommendation Latent Dirichlet Allocation has recently gained some attention for tag recommendation Xiance et al  17  and Krestel et al  16   18  introduce an approach to collective tag recommendation using LDA Xiance et al employ LDA for eliciting topics from the words in documents blogposts and from the associated tags where words and tags form disjoint vocabularies On this basis they recommend new tags for new documents using their content only Krestel et al on the other hand use LDA to infer topics from the available tags of resources and then recommend additional tags from these latent topics In this paper we extend these approaches for personalized tag recommendation by also taking the personal tagging practices of users into account Moreover we show that using a mixture of language models and latent topic models signiìcantly improves the accuracy of tag recommendation Bundschus et al  19  introduce a combination of LD A based on the content and tags of resources and the users having bookmarked a resource The underlying generative process elicits user speciìc latent topics from the resource content and seperately from the tags of the resource The content-based topics and tag-based topics are in a one-to-one correspondence by the user-id On this basis personalized tag recommendation is realized by rst eliciting user speciìc topics from the resource content and then using the corresponding tag-based topics for suggesting tags Our approach does not require content which may not be available e.g for multimedia data but works exlusively on the tags Harvey et al  20  i ntroduce a similar approach to personalized tag recommendation as proposed in this paper on the basis of LDA Rather than decomposing the joint probability of a tag given the tag assignments for a resource and user via an application of Bayes rule see Equation 5  they decompose the joint probability of latent topics given the tag assignments On this basis they introduce an extended Gibbs sampler which draws topics simultaneously from the user and the resource This fully generative approach however requires some initial tags from the user to a given resource in order to recommend additional tags In contrast our approach can also handle the arguably more realistic setting of suggesting tags for a new bookmark without any initial tags from the user

III P ERSONALIZED T AG R ECOMMENDATION MIXING L ANGUAGE M ODELS WITH T OPIC M ODELS In this section we present our approach to combine tag recommendation for users with tag recommendation for resources We show that this combination helps to overcome the weaknesses of the individual approaches applied in isolation On the one hand we take the userês interest and tagging preferences into account and on the other hand we identify suitable tags for a particular resource For both user-centered and resource-centered we investigate the use of two methods Latent Dirichlet Allocation and language models for tag recommendation A Goals and Approach Given a set of resources R  tags T  and users U  the ternary relation X 003 R  T  U represents the user speciìc assignment of tags to resources A bookmark b  r u  for a resource r 004 R and a user u 004 U comprises all tags assigned by u to r  b  r u  002 t 003 r,u X 5  The goal of personalized tag recommendation is to assist users bookmarking a new resource by reducing the cognitive load by suggesting tags for their bookmark b  r u   This can be based on other tag assignments to this resource and similar resources or based on the user and similar users To this end we need to rank possible tags t  given a resource and a user We rank based on a probabilistic approach More formally we estimate the probability P  t  u r  of a tag t given a resource r and a user u as follows P  t  r u  P  r u  t  P  t  P  r u  1 005 P  r  t  P  u  t  P  t  P  r u  2  P  t  r  P  r  P  t  P  t  u  P  u  P  t  P  t  P  r u  3  P  t  r  P  t  u  P  t  P  r  P  u  P  r u  4 006 P  t  r  P  t  u  P  t  5 Equation 1 applies Bayes rule Equation 2 splits P  r u  t  assuming conditional independence of r and u given t  Equation 3 again applies Bayes rule to P  r  t  and P  u  t   Equation 4 simpliìes and Equation 5 discards the factors P  r   P  u   and P  r u   which are equal for all tags P  t  can be estimated via the relative frequency of tag t in all bookmarks For estimating P  t  r  and P  t  u  we investigate and combine two approaches On the one hand we use simple language models Section III-B  on the other hand we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation Section III-C  in order to also recommend tags for new resources and users which have only few bookmarks available The estimate in Equation 5 gives equal weight to P  t  r  and P  t  u   However typically there are more tags available 5 projection 002 and selection 003 operate on multisets without removing duplicate tuples for a particular user u than for a resource r  Thus the estimate for P  t  u  should be weighted more strongly than the estimate for P  t  r   To this end we smoothen P  t  r  and P  t  u  with the prior probability P  t   P 002  t  r  006 log 2   r  1 P  t  r  log 2   u  1 P  t  6 P 002  t  u  006 log 2   u  1 P  t  u  log 2   r  1 P  t  7 where  r  is the number of tags available for a resource r  and  u  is the number of tags available for a user u  When  r  is smaller than  u   P  t  r  is smoothed more strongly and thus inîuences P  t  r u  less than P  t  u   Note that when P  t  r  is zero P 002  t  r  is proportional to P  t   Consequently the combined probability P 002  t  r  007 P 002  t  u  P  t  is effectively proportional to P 002  t  u   Likewise when a resource has no tags at all log 2   r  1  and the combined probability is again proportional to P 002  t  u   The combination above is reminiscent of the popular Product of Experts approach where our Experts are resources and users We have also experimented with the popular mixture which linearly interpolates P  t  r  and P  t  u   But this approach did not achieve competitive results B Language Models The most straightforward approach to tag recommendation is to simply recommend the most frequent tags for each resource More formally the probability for a tag t given a resource r is estimated as P lm  t  r  c  t r  002 t i 003 r c  t i r  8 where c  t r  is the count of tag t in resource r  The probability P lm  t  u  of a user u using tag t is determined in a similar way from all tags the user has assigned Note that we do not need to smoothen the language models as usual because we smoothen P  t  r  and P  t  u  with P  t  via Equations 6 and 7  C Latent Dirichlet Allocation Especially for new resources and users with only few bookmarks the simple language model does not sufìce for tag recommendation because the tag vocabulary of the already available bookmarks may differ from the preferred tag vocabulary of the user Smoothing with the global tag probability only effectively switches off tags that are not available for a resource or user To also recommend topically related tags we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA  21  The general idea of LD A is based on a simple generative model Resources and users are modelled as mixtures of latent topics which in turn consist of a mixture of words When looking at a resource for each tag a user rst chooses one of the topics of the resource and then chooses a tag from this topic Likewise from the perspective of the user the user rst chooses one of her topics of interest from which she chooses the tag More formally the modeling process of LDA can be described as nding a mixture of topics z for each resource r

i.e P  z  r   with each topic described by tags t following another probability distribution i.e P  t  z   This can be formalized as P lda  t  r  Z 003 z 1 P  t  z  P  z  r  9 where P lda  t  r  is the probability of tag t for a given resource r and z ranges over the latent topics of the resource P  t  z  is the probability of tag t within topic z see Equation 11  P  z  r  is the probability of picking a tag from topic z in the resource see Equation 12  The number of latent topics Z has to be deìned in advance and allows to adjust the degree of specialization of the latent topics LDA estimates the topic-tag distribution P  t  z  and the resource-topic distribution P  z  r  from an unlabeled corpus of documents using Dirichlet priors for the distributions and a xed number of topics Gibbs sampling  22  is one possible approach to this end It iterates multiple times over each tag t i in resource r  and samples a new topic z for the tag based on the probability P  z  t i r,z  i  using Equation 10  until the LDA model parameters converge P  z  t i r,z  i  006  C RZ rz  004  C TZ t i z  005 002 t C TZ tz  T\005 10 C TZ maintains a count of all topic-tag assignments C RZ counts the resource-topic assignments z  i represents all topictag and resource-topic assignments except the current assignment z for tag t i  and 004 and 005 are the symmetric hyperparameters for the Dirichlet priors serving as smoothing parameters for the counts Based on the counts the posterior probabilities in Equation 9 can be estimated as follows P  t  z  C TZ tz  005 002 t i C TZ t i j  T\005 11 P  z  r  C RZ rz  004 002 z i C RZ rz i  Z\004 12 The estimation of P lda  t  u  proceeds in the same way as the estimation of P lda  t  r  by operating on the individual tag sets of users rather than resources For resources the resulting topics reîect a collaborative shared view of the resource and the tags of the topics reîect a common vocabulary to describe the resource Table I shows typical examples of resource topics As can be seen the topics group typically co-occuring tags which often will not be used by the same user E.g one user may prefer the tag photography another user may prefer photo or photos For users the resulting topics reîect the topical interests of a user and the tags of topics reîect the individual tagging vocabulary of the user and similar users Table II gives examples of user topics Note that latent topics are not necessarily disjoint E.g hardware occurs in the mac topic as well as in the do it yourself topic but most certainly these two interpretations of hardware are rather disjoint Tag Prob Tag Prob news 0.201 ickr 0.344 technology 0.182 photography 0.167 tech 0.118 photos 0.117 blog 0.082 photo 0.093 daily 0.070 tools 0.089 geek 0.067 web2.0 0.045 blogs 0.029 visualization 0.016 community 0.025 images 0.015 internet 0.023 pictures 0.012 computers 0.021 api 0.010 web 0.018 search 0.009 forum 0.018 internet 0.007 computer 0.015 applications 0.005 software 0.013 sharing 0.004 TABLE I T OP TAGS COMPOSING THE LATENT TOPICS  TECH NEWS  AND  FLICKR  BASED ON RESOURCE PROFILES Tag Prob Tag Prob mac 0.320 diy 0.234 osx 0.215 make 0.099 apple 0.191 hardware 0.084 software 0.170 creativity 0.080 video 0.025 hacks 0.072 quicktime 0.013 electronics 0.070 macintosh 0.012 crafts 0.063 mail 0.012 science 0.046 tv 0.009 mind 0.030 ipod 0.006 theory 0.027 gmail 0.005 photography 0.023 hardware 0.004 engineering 0.019 algorithm 0.003 tutorials 0.017 boot 0.002 language 0.008 TABLE II T OP TAGS COMPOSING THE LATENT TOPICS  MAC  AND  DO IT YOURSELF  BASED ON USER PROFILES By combining these two perspectives using Equation 5  the resource perspective serves as a selector of the topical content of the resources while the user perspective takes into account the individual tagging practices of the user D Combining LDA and LM As P lm  t  r  and P lda  t  r  both constitute normalized probability distributions we can combine these two by straightforward linear interpolation likewise for P  t  u   P  t  r  006 007 P lm  t  r 1  006  007 P lda  t  r  13 We have experimented with a broad range for 006  and achieved consistently good results for 006 in the range of 0  2  0   We report results for 006 004 0  0  0  5  1  0   where 006 0  and 006 1 practically switch off the estimates based on language models and latent topics respectively Combined with the smoothing in Equations 6 and 7  we effectively use a two level smoothing of the simple language model P lm  t  r   First by the more general P lda  t  r  and then by the marginal tag probability P  t

IV E VALUATION Evaluating personalized tag recommendation algorithms is not a trivial task To get precise performance statistics a good way would be to compare two recommendation algorithms in a live tagging system which allows for a direct user evaluation Since this scenario is unfeasable or means interfering with a running system other approaches are prefered One popular way for evaluation is to take existing data from a tagging system and conduct tests on a hold-out set of tags resources or users  7  This approach has a promising characteristic All tags which were used for a resource by a particular user are deìnitly known The drawback is that these tags have been added by the user after being suggested by some automatic algorithm within the tagging system This can bias the tag assignments towards the used tag recommendation algorithm  23  Another disadv antage is that only a small set of correct good tags are actually picked by the user making no distinction between totally unsuited tags and suitable recommended tags which were not picked by the user for whatever reason Note that this leads to an underestimation of the actual tag recommendation quality To extenuate these disadvantages the test dataset has to be designed thoroughly The strength of a recommendation algorithm can only be judged in comparison with other algorithms run on the same dataset Thus we need to compare directly state-of-the-art algorithms with the proposed tag recommendation algorithm on the same dataset Tag distributions for a resource tend to stabilize after around 100 bookmarks  3  This mak es tag recommendation especially challenging for resources having a lot less bookmarks This so-called cold start problem gives the most discriminative results for different algorithms Before we report our results we have a detailed look into the used dataset performance metrics and the used baseline A Dataset As a dataset for our evaluations we use a crawl from Delicious provided by Wetzker et al  24  The dataset consists of nearly 1 million users crawled between December 2007 and April 2008 The retrieval process resulted in about 132 million bookmarks or 420 million tag assignments that were posted between September 2003 and December 2007 Almost 7 million different tags are contained in the dataset and about 55 million different urls were annotated To do the computations in memory and in a reasonable time we were forced to use only a sample of the whole dataset The huge amount of data and the fact that no spam ltering was done also results in a very sparse overlap between tags resources and users To get a dense subset of the sampled data we computed p cores  25  for dif ferent le v els For p 20 we get enough bookmarks for each resource to split the data based on resources into meaningful training and test sets 90%:10 The 20 core ensures that each tag each resource and each user appears at least 20 times in the tag assignments For the 10 resources in the test set we only include the bookmarks for the rst n users  n 004 1  3  5  7  10  20  who annotated a resource into the training set This results in a setting close to real life situations where users often annotate a resource previously annotated by only afew n  other users As soon as a resource is annotated by many users tag recommendation can exploit the stabilized tag distribution  3  for resources and recommending good tags becomes less challenging The proposed setup allows to analyze how well different algorithms can generalize from relatively few tags available for a resource similuating the cold start problem in tagging environments Parameter settings were tested on 1  256 of the data We have ve test sets containing 10 of the resources with different numbers of known bookmarks On this set the only preprocessing of the tag assignments performed was the decapitalization of the tags No stemming or other simpliìcations were applied More sophisticated preprocessing improve the results but would complicate the evaluation of the algorithms and the comparison of different methods B Evaluation Measures We use standard information retrieval evaluation metrics to report and compare the performance of the algorithms  P@1  precision at one Percentage of test cases where the rst recommended tag was actually used by the user to annotate the resource This is the same as success at one S@1  P@5  precision at ve Percentage of tags among the rst ve recommended tags that where actually used by the user Averaged over all test cases  S@5  success at ve Percentage of test cases where at least one of the rst ve recommended tags was used by the user  S@uAVG  success at user average Percentage of test cases where at least one of the recommended tags was used by the user The number of recommended tags is the average number of tags per other bookmark for the user  P@uAVG  precision at user average Percentage of tags among the top n recommended tags that where actually used by the user where n is again the average number of tags per bookmark  R@uAVG  recall at user average Percentage of user tags among the top n recommended tags n as above  Fma@5  f1 macro average at ve The

a good estimation of the performance of our tag recommendation algorithms we compare the results with the results from FolkRank  6  F olkRank FR is one of the stateof-the-art tag recommender algorithms Its recommendations are very accurate but this comes with high computational costs In contrast to our approach FolkRank does not make use of latent topics but relies on a graph representation of the folksonomy The basic idea is to adapt PageRank  26  to get scores for tags A graph G  V E  is constructed from the folksonomy F  U R T X   where the vertices are users resources and tags  R 010 U 010 T  and the edges are co-occurences of tags and users tags and resources and users and resources within tag assignments  u t r  004 X  The symmetric characteristic of the graph G would lead to scores biased towards popular i.e highly connected entities within the graph when employing the adapted PageRank ap Thus folkrank uses a differential approach and computes the scores for each node based on the difference between a regular PageRank computation and a personalized PageRank like e.g in  27  using a preference v ector  For tag recommendation this preference vector is highly biased towards two entries the user and the resource for whom the recommendation is computed  11  T o compare F olkRank with LDA and LM employed only on resources or only on users we only boost one entry in the preference vector  the resource or the user in question This gives either resourcecentered or user-centered FolkRank results The FolkRank scores are computed iteratively and nally

row-stochastic version of the adjacency matrix of G  V R ESULTS We have systematically applied the described approaches for estimating P  t  r   P  t  u   and P  t  u r   and compared them to the corresponding results using FolkRank Table III gives a complete overview for tag recommendation when there is only one bookmark available for the resource The rst four rows give the results for taking only the user perspective into account i.e tags are predicted based on P  t  u  only or for FolkRank the preference vector is only biased towards the user We see that generally the probabilistic approach introduced in this paper outperforms FolkRank FR w.r.t all measures The simple smoothed language model approach LM slightly outperforms LDA The linear interpolation of LM with LDA achieves a very slight improvement over LM and LDA alone It is also clear that the user perspective in isolation performs worse than the resource perspective next four rows This is to be expected The mixture of topics that a user is interested in is typically much more diverse than the mixture of topics a particular resource is about Thus no matter how the tag probabilities are estimated just recommending the most likely tags for a user disregarding the resource will often go astray The general trends for tag recommendation based on resources only second four rows are slightly different FR and LM are rather clearly outperformed on all measures but among them for some measures FR is better than LM and vice versa LDA comes on a clear second place and a very clear winner is is again the linear interpolation of LM and LDA It is interesting that LDA outperforms LM on resources while LM outperforms LDA on users The strength of LDA is to generalize from the tagging practices of individual users who have assigned tags to a particular resource such as photography in order to also include semantically related tags such as photo This strength turns out to be a slight weakness for the user perspective possibly because users tend to stick to a particular vocabulary and thus the generalization by LDA does not help

VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we have explored user-centered and resourcecentered approaches for personalized tag recommendation We compared and employed a language modeling approach and an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation We furthermore thoroughly investigated the use of language models and LDA for tag recommendation showing that simple language models built from users and resources yield competitive performance while consuming only a fraction of the computational costs compared to more sophisticated algorithms We showed that the combination of both methods LDA and LM tailored to users and resources outperforms state-of-the-art tag recommendation algorithms with respect to a broad variety of performance metrics For future work we want to investigate the use of these methods for item or user/community recommendation in the context of tagging systems It would also be interesting to see whether the behavior of the algorithms changes when applied to a photo or video tagging system instead of a tagging system for web pages Finally we also plan to investigate how additional contextual knowledge such as time location and current task can be used to further improve tag

                                Box 3.1. Basics of Survival Analysis  A comprehensive discussion of this topic in the context of PHM can be found in Ma and Krings \(2008a Survival analysis, also known as failure time analysis, has become a de facto standard for analyzing time-to-event data in biomedical research in the last two decades Survival analysis studies positive random variables for describing times to events in concern, also known as survival time, failure time, or simply time-to-event  Survivor Function and Hazard Function  Survivor function and hazard function are two of the most fundamental definitions in survival analysis. The survivor function S\(t time \(T is lt;&lt;?= ttTPtS 0   Note that S\(t function R\(t instantaneous rate of failure at T=t, conditional upon survival to time t.  It is defined as      lim  0 tS tf t tTttTtPt t  lt The above definitions are for univariate survival analysis; survival analysis has been extended to multivariate systems, or the multivariate survival analysis Hougaard 2000, Ma and Krings 2008c 3.7 and 3.8 for Multivariate Survival Analysis  Fundamental Model of Survival Analysis  


 Cox \(1972 most fundamental model in survival analysis. It is a semi-parametric model that correlates conditional survivor \(hazard vector \(z  Hazard Function ?\(t, z covariate vector z zetzt  0 where ?0 \(t function for continuous failure time T  Conditional Survival Functions \(on z   0   ztSztS where  t duutS 0 00 exp is the baseline survivor function  There are numerous extensions to Cox's model \(e.g Therneau and Grambsch 2000, Martinussen &amp; Scheike 2006 8                             UUUR, survival analysis, competing risks analysis, and multivariate survival analysis can be utilized to assess the effects of UUUR events. This forms the foundation of tactical level modeling in the three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008  3.2. Competing Risks Analysis  Competing risks analysis \(Box 3.2; Ma &amp; Krings 2008b for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability subject of survival analysis. It has a history dating back to 1760 when Daniel Bernoulli studied the risks around the smallpox inoculation. However, modern competing risks analysis draw extensively on survival analysis, which was only initiated in late 1950s but the active research was not conducted until the1970s The application of competing risks analysis in reliability is quite earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 


earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 1967 controversies around the issues of identifiability, which shadows its value when multiple latent risks are dependent.  Three excellent monographs exist for competing risks analysis \(David &amp Moeschberger 1978, Crowder 2001, Pintilie 2006 perspective of survivability analysis, competing risks analysis can be used for analyzing the effects of unpredictable risks by treating the unpredictable events as censored or the effects of latent risks We use the term latent risks to refer to potential failure risks \(but only one of the risks ultimately causes the system failure survivability analysis; this usage of latent risks is totally consistent with the concept of latent risks in competing risks analysis, where these risks are modeled precisely  3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis                                                      Cont' Box 3.1  Another model that is of nearly comparable status with Cox model is the Accelerated Failure Time model 


Cox model is the Accelerated Failure Time model AFT e.g., Kalbfleisch &amp; Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003  Mean Residual Life \(MRL The mean residual life \(MRL lifetime for a sensor node of "age" t and is defined as   tTtTEtMRL &gt  It can be proved that the following equation holds Klein and Moeschberger 2003             tS dxxS tS dxxftT tMRL tt     where S\(t  Proportional Mean Residual Life Models exp  0 ztmztm T that m\(t|z the covariates, and m0\(t lifetime \(Oakes and Dasu 1990; Chen &amp; Cheng 2005 This model should be particularly useful for PHM Box 3.2. Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C 


represents the marginal distribution of C  The sub-density function f\(j, t represented by  dttjdStjf The marginal survivor function and marginal density of T can be calculated with kj tjStS 1       1? ==?= kj tjfdttdStf The related conditional probabilities are Pr \(time t |cause j j, t Pr \(cause j | time t j, t t Pr\(time t | cause j caused by j, for example, the survival time distribution of cancer patients in a biomedical experiment. Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
