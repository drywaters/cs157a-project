The same time system 
implements digital zoom and LCD screen touch controlling and modulating video contrast and brightness  Keywords DM642; LCD; Touch-control I  INTRODUCTION Nowadays, images are widely used in many fields. People want to see what happens, not just a result. So video capture and display is important more and more. We can get video from a camera, and we also could show the video on a traditional CRT display or a LCD screen. And the used of touch import equipment is favor for us. All of those video capture and display and touch controlling implement on a 
2.8 inch board that is what this paper do. At the same time this platform can implement nine digital zooms and modulate video contrast and brightness in CRT display and LCD screen[6~7    In respect that we use a digital multimedia processor that is TMS320DM642[1 That is an ef fect i v e i m a g e  processing fixed-point DSP of TI Company.

A  Video capture A video camera captures an analog video that comes to the video ADC changed to digital signal. Before that the DSP should configure the ADC to PAL formula through IIC bus control. Because the DSP-DM642 has IIC controller, so it is easy to implement. Then the digital video will store in SDRAM through VP0 port of the DSP Firstly the DSP configure VP0 port to video capture module. Secondly digital comes to the FIFO of VP0 and then stored in SD r o u gh E D MA m o d e A t  la s t  we gain the digital video data The size of video data from ADC is 720 by 576 YCbCr4:2:2. Because the size of LCD screen is 320 by 240 pixels, we should cut the video to fit the LCD. So when we show video on CRT display and LCD screen the size of the image is the same large B  Video display Video display includes CRT display and LCD screen. The digital video data store in SDRAM, the DSP could transmit that data to DAC through VP2 by EDMA. Firstly DSP configures the VP2 port to video model. Then DSP configures the DAC to PAL formula through IIC bus controller. Finally we can see video showing on CRT display The CRT display model is easy because the video come form VP0 that is PAL formula and display is also PAL formula by VP2. It not needs any transfer except the size of image. But the LCD display is different from CRT. The image formula of camera and CRT is YCbCr4:2:2, but the image formula of LCD is RGB. We need transfer that to fit it The equations show as follows R=Y+1.14V \(1 G=Y-0.39U-0.58V  \(2 B=Y+2.03U  \(3 Due to the DSP is fixed-point; we convert the transfer equations to the follows. The effect of LCD display is satisfaction R=Y+V+V/8 \(4 G=Y-U/4-U/8-V/2-V/16  \(5 B=Y+2U  \(6 When we get RGB image, the DSP transmit that to LCD screen by EMIF port. The DSP can process the video signal efficiently. So it can modulate the contrast and brightness CRT display and LCD screen to what we need C  Touch screen controlling The LCD has a touch screen, so we should control it by DSP. And we need a touch controller. In this paper we use the ADS7846 to control the touch screen The touch screen is resistance model. When we touch the screen it will generate analog signal to ADS7846, and it can transmit the signal to digital coordinate. The DSP gets the coordinate from VP1 port. Before that the DSP should configure the VP1 port to McBSP model. The DSP send a getting X coordinate order, then the ADS7846 will give out it to DSP. The Y coordinate is the same model The table 1 shows almost a vertical line and table 2 shows almost a horizontal line 1 vertical line X 2123 2098 2092 2080 2082 2098 2073 2088  Y  057 280 520 749 979 1226 1451 1701 2 horizontal line X 3835 3521 3211 2899 2569 2227 1912 1601 1287 955 Y 2156 2159 2159 2162 2157 2157 2153 2186 2166 2132 When we get a coordinate of the touch screen, we can plot a cross on the image. And the cross move follow the touch. The purpose of the cross is that we can point out a target what we need. The implement is that the DSP generates a black and white cross stored in SDRAM and then add the cross on the image. When image shows on display we can see the cross and it moving follow our finger touch on the LCD screen The figure 2 shows an image added a cross

 Figure 2 added a cross image III  DIGITAL ZOOM ALGORITHM We store original video data in SDRAM, and that we can get digital zoom image by DSP. The digital zoom algorithm has several ways. On this platform we can implement two algorithms. According to need it can select one to implement One algorithm is nearest interpolation that is simply and fast but the effect is not so good. And the other is bilinear interpolation that is difficult and slow, but the effect is excellence The size of original image is 320 by 240 pixels. We should implement 9 times digital zoom. Then we get 960 by 720 pixels. The CRT display and LCD screen both show 320 by 240 image, so we cut the centre image of 960 by 720 data to get 320 by 240 data A Nearest interpolation This algorithm is a simple digital image zoom method The advantage is the speed; it is so fast to get a large digital zoom. Though the effect is not so good, it is all the same used widely On this hardware platform the DSP read original image from SDRAM pixel by pixel. And then the DSP copy one pixel to nine pixels. So a 320 by 240 image become to a 960 by 720 image. At last we store this new image to SDRAM Due to the image is color. One pixel is constituted by three image data. So we should do three times this step When it needs to show on CRT display and LCD screen the DSP read the new image data and send it to CRT display by VP2 port and to LCD screen by EMIF port B Bilinear interpolation This algorithm puts one original pixel to nine pixels though nearby four original pixel. The transfer equation shows as formula equation \(7 1-u\\(i,j+1 u\(1-v\f\(i+1,j\+ uvf\(i+1,j+1 7 F\(i+u,j+v\he new pixel and u, v below to 1. The \(i,j i,j+1\\(i+1,j\and \(i+1,j+1\ are the four nearby pixels For implement of this algorithm on DSP, we do some change to adapt the DSP need. The bilinear interpolation is divided to two steps. The first step is horizontal interpolation We read image data from the SDRAM horizontal line by line, and then insert one now pixel such as Y  to near two pixels such as X 1 and X 2 The new pixel vale shows as equation \(8\. At last we store the new image in SDRAM The original image is 320 by 240, and the new image is 960 by 240 The second step is vertical interpolation .When we end first step, we read this new image vertical line by line. The way is just the same as step one. We insert one now pixel such as Y  to near two pixels such as Y 1 and Y 2 The new pixel vale shows as equation \(9\hen we get the image of 960 by 720 X= X 1 3 + 2*X 2 3 \(8 Y= 2*Y 1 3 + Y 2 3 \(9 Because the image is three colors and the CRT is YCbCr4:2:2 and LCD screen is RGB, we should do three times of that. At last we cut the center image of 320 by 240 to transmit that image to CRT display and LCD screen IV  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Through a video camera we get an original image just like figure3 shows. We store this image in SDRAM and show it on CRT display and LCD screen. Then we get two digital zoom images by nearest interpolation and bilinear

interpolation. The figure 4 shows the nearest interpolation image and the figure 5 shows the bilinear interpolation image  Figure 3 original image  Figure 4 nearest interpolation image  Figure 5 bilinear interpolation image We can see that the bilinear interpolation image is more trenchancy then the nearest interpolation image. The bilinear interpolation adapt high quality image digital zoom. But the disadvantage is that algorithm is difficult and slow speed. So this system can select one of these two methods by button of LCD touch screen V  CONCLUSIONS In this paper we implement a hardware platform. The hardware platform mainly consist a fixed-point DSP and a video ADC and a video DAC. That system gets digital video from a camera and shows it on CRT display and LCD screen And a touch screen has carried out. We can add tracking frame on a target that we interest At the same time two digital image zoom algorithm can implement on this platform. At last we give out the result of cross added on image and moving through touch control. We also show the two algorithm of digital zoom, and get the conclusion bilinear interpolation is perfect than nearest interpolation REFERENCES  1  TMS320DM642 Hardware Designer Resource Guide[M TI  2 005 2  TI.

4.1 Dealing with Complex Hazard Functions As indicated before one of the main problems dealing with malicious acts such as intrusions or other attacks are the different degrees of unpredictability In this was captured with the introduction of so-called UUUR events Unpredictable latent Unobserved and Unobservable Risks In order to assess the consequences of UUUR events survival analysis with its sister elds competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis were introduced in and 16 respecti v ely  A three-layer survi vability analysis architecture was introduced that consisted of tactical strategic and operational levels This architecture allows to integrate reliability hybrid fault models and survivability under a unied paradigm A comprehensive introduction of three-layer survivability analysis is beyond the scope of this paper Here we only briey discuss one aspect of the tactical level dealing with complex hazard functions We completely skip the strategic and operational level modeling which can be found in and In the absence of UUUR events the tactical level is largely equivalent to traditional reliability analysis Indeed the most fundamental denition in survival analysis is the survivor function S  t  Pr  T>t   which has the exact same denition as the reliability function The hazard function h  t  and the cumulative hazard functions H  t  even use the same terminology besides the common mathematical denitions However there are additional advantages from introducing survival analysis over the traditional reliability analysis Major advantages of survival analysis are i more exible time-variant and covariates-dependent hazard functions ii built-in procedures to deal with censored events iii multivariate failure beyond binary failure and iv more effective modeling of dependent failure events through competing risks and shared frailty modeling Details can be found in 13 14 15 Our interest is with regard to the hazard functions listed in the advantages of i Therefore we now briey introduce several forms of hazard functions from survival analysis to show one of the advantages of adopting survival analysis The simplest type of hazard function is the constant hazard function which is when the failure time follows exponential distribution It takes the form h  t   1 With the original Cox Proportional Hazards Model PHM the hazard function becomes time and covariates dependent   t z   0  t  e Z 2 where Z is the vector of covariates such as environment factors that inuence the hazard function and  o  t  is the baseline hazard function The Cox PHM has been extended numerously e.g 18  T w o simple e xtensions the stratied Cox PHM and the Cox PHM with time-dependent covariates are of particular interest and their applicability will be discussed below First we introduce the stratied Cox PHM Suppose there is a factor that occurs on q levels and for which the socalled proportionality assumption of PHM may be violated The hazard function for an individual in the j th stratum or level of this factor is  j  t z   0 j  t  e Z 3 for j 1  2   q  The baseline hazard function  01       0 q    for the q strata are permitted to be arbitrary and are completely unrelated The second generalization to the PHM is the Cox PHM with time-dependent covariates Here the covariates Z depend on time t  i.e Z  Z  t   For unstratied PHM the hazard function is   t  z  t    0  t  e Z  t   4 and for stratied PHM it is  j  t  z  t    0 j  t  e Z  t   j 1  2   q 5 With the increase of the hazard function complexity from Equation 1 to 5 their descriptive power and exibility also increase For example the stratied PHM Equations 3 and 5 may be used to formulate a unied hazard function for various levels of security alerts e.g low medium and high The choice of the hazard function that can be used has signicant implications on the complexity of the system analysis 4.2 Model Changes and State Changes The view of the functionality-based analysis model described above has several advantages in theory 1 Different functionalities can have different fault descriptions 2 Different functionalities can utilize different hazard functions 3 Each functionality may change its fault description and/or hazard function in time The rst advantage is the exibility to view the fault description of each functionality in isolation This design for analyzability feature allows for ease of analysis The second advantage is signicant since the type of hazard function has huge implications on the complexity of the analysis Note that the term complexity is not to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


interpreted as computational complexity but as the complexity of the approach Having the exibility of selecting an appropriate hazard function for individual functionalities rather than for the entire complex system allows to study the effects of specic assumptions about failing rates This way one can move in the trade-off space of simplicity of analysis versus accuracy of the hazard function For example the simple hazard function of Equation 1 is suitable for the analysis of certain functionalities but it is not generally suitable for malicious act From an analysis point of view it is desirable to select the least complicated hazard function suitable for each functionality Thus just because certain aspects of the systems may be subjected to UUUR events the entire system does not have to use the complicated hazard model The third advantage is the exibility to consider the analysis in different phases with potentially different hazard functions at different stages This can be modeled using a state machine Consider the three different threat levels e.g low medium and high one may use the stratied Cox PHM model expressed with Equations 3 and 5 Such system may adapt to threat levels announced by some authority The system hazard function may transition from one stratum to another when the threat levels change For example the sequence h i   h k   h j   h i would represent a system that transitions through various states strata each with their respective hazard functions The sequence could be from the state machine shown in Figure 1  h i h k h j Figure 1 Thread Model State Machine 5 Fault Model Adaptation As information becomes available that may change the systems landscape changes to the system model or parameters need to be considered Such adaptation is considered to be an integrated feature in any design for survivability For example in 6 survi v ability w a s described in terms of Resistance Recognition Recover and Adaptation Adaptation implemented the mechanism to adapt the system to knowledge gained in the prior three phases Our interest is primarily in adaptation related to the fault model Adaptation may be the result of diverse scenarios such as 1 The fault description F i is no longer valid due to a specic event For example intelligence suggests that authentication may be compromised As a result fault types that are not reected in F i may occur 2 The fault description of f i should be strengthened by design This may be the result of analysis indicating that a functionality may be the weakest link 3 The infrastructure that f i relied on has changed The implications of this change on the fault description need to be evaluated Of special interest is the case where the infrastructure may not be able to support tolerance of certain fault types In general adaptation is viewed to address the dynamics of changes in fault descriptions F i  which however has to be addressed in the context of the capabilities of the system or infrastructure that supports functionality f i  Thus we want to be able to point out if there is a mismatch between 1 what is assumed or implemented by f i and 2 inherently theoretically possible in the system We dene the active fault description as the fault model that the system currently subscribes to i.e the faults that f i assumes to be able to tolerate or deal with Thus for functionality f i the fault description F i is the active fault description The specication of F i is determined by the system designer or more specically by the designer of f i  The real question that remains is whether the systems infrastructure can support this F i  In contrast to the active fault description the imposed fault description denoted by  F i  is the fault model that the infrastructure of the system or application imposes on f i  It encompasses those fault types that the system has to explicitly deal with by distinct mechanisms For example  F i  b s  indicates that for the given infrastructure benign and symmetric faults are possible and theoretically unavoidable However note that  F i does not list asymmetric faults The reason is that the infrastructure is assumed to be capable of theoretically eliminating this fault type An infrastructure that has an imposed fault description  F i  b s  is a broadcast network In such a network asymmetric faults are not possible due to the fact that every module in the broadcast domain can see every message The active and imposed fault descriptions can serve the system designers to analyze the survivability of f i  Lets consider the authentication example in a general network environment under the fault model of and assume that messages are signed First we assume that point-to-point communication e.g TCP/IP is used Furthermore consider the two cases where 1 TCP/IP provides reliable transmission and 2 when TCP may time out With respect to the infrastructure in case 1 this leads to an imposed fault description of  F i  s a   meaning that there are no benign Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


faults However value faults both symmetric and asymmetric cannot be resolved without explicit mechanisms If we consider case 2 in which TCP may time out then  F i  b s a   Next lets consider the active fault descriptions If our authentication scheme is assumed to be uncompromisable then F i  b   otherwise it is F i  b s a   The interesting case in the example above is when authentication is compromised Value faults cannot be dealt with unless the authentication mechanism is implemented to provide redundancy levels of N  2 s 1 and N  3 a 1 for symmetric and asymmetric behavior respectively Note that in order to avoid common mode faults the redundant modules should be dissimilar In order to deal with symmetric faults one needs a simple majority of unaffected modules However asymmetric faults do not only require a higher degree of redundancy but also require that agreement algorithms be used These algorithms typically work in rounds of message exchanges The result is high message overhead in addition to the high component count However since in our example the imposed and active fault descriptions both contain s and a  there is no easy way around having to deal with these faults explicitly For the system designer the choices seem clear 1 one lives with the risk of authentication compromises or 2 one pays the cost of module and message overhead But how high is that cost This depends on how many faults of type s and a one wants to tolerate In addition common mode faults need to be addresses and thus the cost of dissimilar components needs to be considered Design Changes The advantage of working with imposed fault description is that it gives insight about what the infrastructure cannot inherently deal with This allows for adaptation that can bring signicant simplications to the application Consider the example above and assume that authentication may be compromised i.e assume that F i   F i  b s a   The largest challenge is to avoid having to deal with costly asymmetric faults However the infrastructure cannot tolerate such faults implicitly and thus explicit mechanisms such as agreement algorithms must be used Therefore lets consider what changes can be made to the infrastructure in order to avoid asymmetric faults With respect to networking this is actually quite simple As indicated before a broadcast environment cannot exhibit asymmetric behavior Therefore assume that point-to-point networking in authentication is eliminated and that broadcasting is used instead Under the broadcast paradigm every node can see the same messages so that Byzantine faults can be immediately detected Now  F i  b s   and thus the application can provide simple mechanisms to take advantage of the imposed tolerance to asymmetric faults Thus by observing the limitations of the imposed fault description an infrastructure-related change can make large improvements Adaptive Policies In the previous example the design of the authentication mechanism was motivated by low cost which resulted in an active model considering only benign faults If value faults are suspected then the high cost of dealing with value faults most signicantly asymmetric faults was required However in most applications the worse case behavior e.g broken authentication may be only of importance during times of high threat levels This suggest a security policy that is exible and sensitive to the threat level Such a policy would select the lowest overhead solution possible under a given threat level In our authentication example this could mean using the benign model under normal situations and augmenting value faults if the threat level is high Such gear shifting is not new and has been used in the context of agreement algorithms to reduce overhead Infrastructure Changes Lastly if the infrastructure used by functionalities f i changes then one should consider if these changes have implications on the imposed fault description If they do then perhaps one can take advantage of this change On the other hand it may mean that now the limitations of the infrastructure need to be compensated by more sophisticated solutions An example of such degeneration is when a network changes from a broadcast to a point-to-point communication primitive In all the cases above the careful analysis of F i and  F i should be undertaken Misjudging the fault model can render the application non-survivable 6 Conclusions A new view of fault models was presented that shifted away from the fault cause and instead focused on the effect of faults This allows for the use of fault models in the analysis of systems operating in hostile environments A general view of design for survivability was adopted This implied that the application and infrastructure were viewed in concert in order to determine which fault models they required and supplied By viewing a system as a collection of functionalities each functionality could be separately analyzed This simplied the determination of the active and imposed fault description which was then used to determine a mapping between what the application functionality required and what the infrastructure could or could not support In the latter case explicit solutions must be used to overcome the infrastructure induced limitations With respect to system analysis the functionality-based view of the system allowed exibility in the choice of hazard functions Rather than using one model for the entire system now each functionality can be analyzed using its appropriate hazard functions

 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence

It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
