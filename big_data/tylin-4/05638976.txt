1 Mobile Power Equipment: Its Impact on Power Supply Reliability Ying He Member, IEEE Anders Nilsson, and Fredrik Carlsson Member, IEEE  Abstract Mobile power equipment is an important measure to reduce customer outages. It en ables power-uninterrupted repairs and maintenance. It can be added to the networks to quickly restore power service after fault occurrence and hence reduce power outage time. This pap er presents th e results of a project recently performed within the Smart Grids R&D program at the power company Vattenfall, in Sweden. The project analyzed, among other things, the effect of using mobile power equipment on power supply reliability based on the outage data and statistics from Vattenfall network company in Sweden The results show that there is bi g potential in reducing outages and increasing reliability of power supply. By using mobile power equipment combined wi th LW \(live working interruption-free work in both st ation environment and on power lines can be performed. This will potentially eliminate planned outages up to 90% and hence significantly improve the utility’s power service reliability Keywords forced customer interruption, loss of power supply, mobile power equipment, mobile power supplies, outage duration, outage frequency planned customer interruption power equipment, reliability, and reliability estimation I.

Mobile equi pment offers possibility to enhance power supply reliability and reduces investment cost of fixed redundant equipment There are many advantages to have proper mobile power equipment It enables reducing customer power outages. It allows operation and repair crews to complet ely isolate equipment for maintenance or repairs without disrupting power service. This reduces maintenance and repair related power interruptions and outage durations, and enhances power service reliability Mobile power equipment can be utilized to provide poweruninterrupted service Mobile equipment offers be tter working environment for repair and maintenance crews. The crews do not need working with electrical voltage. When you can, for example completely isolate a transformer by using a mobile transformer you can do a better job Installation of redundant network components on power systems can increase service reliability, but is expensive Mobile equipment can be used as moveable spare network component and can be soon placed in service. Mobile equipment allows therefore reduction of investment on redundant network components In order to reduce customer outages and increase power service reliability, a project was recently performed within the R&D program Smart Grids at the power company, Vattenfall in Sweden. The purpose of the project is to study and analyze mobile power equipment related issues and search for a costeffective way for the application One of the important issues studied in the project is how much power supply reliability can be increased and how much power outages can be reduced by using mobile power equipm ent. Based on the outage data and statistics from Vattenfall network company in Sweden the project analyzed the potential in reducing customer outages and evaluated the impact of mobile power equipment on power supply reliability The detailed analysis and the results are presented and discussed in the subsequent sections of the paper III.  M OBILE POWER EQUIPMENT Mobile power equipment is an important tool to reduce customer interruptions. It has been found many applications worldwide for reducing customer outage time and for restoring power by emergency back up power supply The applications of the vehicle on-board mobile power M 


2 equipment are in principle at two levels: station level and component level. At the station level, the whole station is assembled on one or two trailers and could be moved easily to the load site to give emergency power supply. The mobile substation cabinet mounted on the trailer may include substation transformer, disconnect switches, circuit breakers and fuses. There may be also a ground fault protection system low voltage control transformer, circuit breaker panel, and low voltage control panel used to check current and voltage for each feed. The transformer monitor may also be included. The mobile power station can be const ructed in high capacity and soon be placed in service in need of a temporary power station At the component applica tion level, various types of equipment are used, including mobile power generators transformers, switches etc. They can be quickly transported and added to the networks to substitute the individual power component that needs to be removed from service for repairs and maintenance. Mobile power generator is an important component. It offers flexibl e modes of power generation and is widely used as back up and emergency power supply. There are various sized mobile generators available, from several kW portable generator sets up to approximately one MW power generator system. The controller based mobile engine generator can be back up not onl y three-phase but also singlephase distribution line Today vehicle and mobile power equipment are, to some extent, used at Vattenfall network and service companies They are used in some of the maintenance and repair work in order to give emergency power supply and reduce downtime of power supply. Several types of mobile power equipment are utilized including  Mobile power substations  By-pass switch cabins  Auxiliary power supply \(mobile power generator  Mobile transformers  Mobile power cables Vattenfall Distribution Nordic has developed the concept on mobile substation. A mobile 40/20/10 kV substation, called Rulle, has been in service since 2005. Another one, called Bamse, 170/55/24 kV, was put on voltage in Aug. 2007 Today they are functioning well and used mainly for four purposes: \(1\ergency power supply in the case of failure at sub-transmission station; \(2\substitute the equipment at sub-transmission station that needs to be removed from service for repairs and maintenance; \(3 energize quickly temporary load s; \(4 when rebuilding or reconstructing the station By-pass switch cabin, as shown in Fig. 1 is one type of mobile power equipment u tilized frequently by Vattenfall Service in the work of network repair and maintenance. It has a built-in-disconnector with fuses, and by connecting with insulated rubber cables it bypasses the objects to be maintained or repaired. Due to the device connected in parallel over the object, one can perform maintenance and repair without breaking th e power service. The by-pass unit consists mainly of a 24 kV sw itch station with fuse-loadswitches, rubber cables of length 3 x 20 m + 3 x 15 m insulators with outlet for measure ment of test instruments, and earthing equipment. Vattenfall service company fully utilizes their by-pass switch units in performing interruption-free maintenance and repair of components in switch station environment, such as switches, circuit breakers, bus-bars insulators, transformers, etc Fig. 1.  12 – 24 kV by-pass switch unit Fig. 2 shows MV mobile power supply equipment-set which makes up of a power generator, a secondary substation inclusive a transformer, protec tion and switch equipment and a piece of power cable. This arrangement offers flexible modes for emergency power service. It supports quick power recovery from line or cable failures, transformer failures, and failures on secondary sub-stations. It can be also used for interruption-free maintenance and repair work Fig. 2.  MV mobile power supply equipment-set Potential benefits of using mobile power equipment in increasing power supply reliability are gained mainly from three aspects  Reduce number of scheduled outages by arranging in advance mobile power equipment to substitute without interrupting custom ers, the equipment that needs to be removed from service for repairs and 


3 maintenance  Reduce duration of scheduled outages by arranging mobile equipment to substitute the equipment that needs to be removed in a long time from service for repairs and maintenance  Reduce durations of forced outages by using mobile power equipment supply emergency power and quickly restore power service The subsequent sections describe the project work and analyses of potential reduction of scheduled power outages and associated improvement in power supply reliability by using mobile power equipment. The analyses were performed based on the input data and outage statistics at Vattenfall Distribution Sweden IV.  P OTENTIAL REDUCTION OF SCHEDULED OUTAGES The power systems are subject to planned interruptions Planned interruptions are scheduled in order to perform various activities, such as main tenance, equipment testing installation of new or upgraded equipment, connecting new customers, network refurbishment and equipment repair and replacement. The most common causes of planned power interruptions are  Maintenance  Repair work and equipment replacement  Network rebuild, upgrade, and reinforcement  New network connections From time to time Vattenf all Distribution Sweden carries out the work on the electricity systems to maintain and upgrade the networks. For practical reasons the power supply is sometimes intentionally interrupt ed to enable the work on the networks. An analysis of about 130 operation orders for the planned power interruptions in 2007 showed that approximately 57% planned power interruptions were attributed to maintenance and network rebuild and upgrades 16% due to equipment repair and replacement, and 27% due to new network and customer connections, as shown in Fig. 3     Planned interruptions by cause 57 16 27  Maintenance, network rebuild and upgrade Repair work New network connections Fig. 3.  Planned interruptions by cause The further analysis of the in terruptions by equipment category shows that the pl anned customer outages due to maintenance and work on lines and cables account for approximately 58% of all the scheduled outages, and the planned work on power stations accounts for around 39 The company is continually upgrading and maintaining its networks. During maintenance or upgrade works, both DW method \(working without volta ge, i.e., working with planned customer interruptions\and LW technique \(live working or working with voltage, i.e working without customer interruptions\ost of the network upgrading and maintaining work is performed with planned customer interruptions according to the statistics in 2007 Vattenfall Service has developed different LW methods Utilization of mobile power equipment together with the LW techniques serves as an important way in the live-line working practice. The mobile by-pass switch units, mobile cables as well as mobile generators are, for example, used in combination with LW techniques and become important elements in the interruption-free work on power systems This combined technique ma y include various types of mobile components. When performing work, mobile equipment is connected to th e network using LW method without interrupting power supply to replace the equipment that needs to be removed from service for maintenance and repair. Thanks to the mobile equipment, the device being worked upon can be completely isolated, and the maintenance/repair work can then be carried on in voltage-off states. When you can completely isolate the device with the proper mobile power equipment you can do a better job. This combined technique enables therefore interruption-free better maintenance and repair work on power networks and influences on considerable reduc tion of planned customer interruptions Vattenfall Service, who has the high skills needed to perform LW work, can, with th e help of combined mobile power equipment and LW method, perform interruption-free work in both station envi ronment and on power lines. This skill and the combined mobile power equipment and LW technique give great opportunities for continually upgrading and maintaining power networks wit hout disrupting electricity supply and allow eliminating the planned customer outages practically expected up to 90 V.  P OTENTIAL IMPACT ON POWER SUPPLY RELIABILITY Eliminating the planned custo mer outages has very positive impact on power supply reliability. This section presents the results of the project work that estimates how much the power supply reliability can be potentially increased if the planned customer interruptions could be eliminated by 90 SAIFI \(System Average Inte rruption Frequency Index commonly used as an important reliability index by power utilities to indicate how often a cu stomer would be interrupted over a year. Performance based SAIFI is calculated by SAIFI = total number of custo mer interruptions / total number of customers served 


4 The customer interruptions are directly related to the SAIFI and the total number of planned customer interruptions was calculated over the period of 2004 – 2007. An overview of the results of the calculations is su mmarized in TABLE 1, which gives the total customer interruptions on the networks of the company by voltage level and by outage duration TABLE 2 shows the contributions of total planned customer interruptions on 0.4 – 135 kV networks to the utility’s SAIFI values. The planned outages gave 0.35 – 0.55 interruptions per customer year in average.

This paper presen ts the results of a project recently performed at the power company, Vattenfall, in Sweden. The project studied mobile power equipment related issues for application purpose. One of important concerns was how far we could increase power supply reliability and how much we could reduce scheduled power outages by using mobile equipment Based on the performance data and outage statistics of a period of four years at Vattenfall network company in Sweden, the project analyzed impact on power service reliability by application of mobile power equipment. The analysis shows that mobile power equipment combined with LW technique has potential to eliminate planned customer outages expected up to 90% and improves the reliability significantly. The company’s SAIFI value would be potentially improved by 13-17%. A potential 8-22 improvement of the company’s SAIDI value would be realized. The overall system reliability would then be increased from 99.86-99.96% to 99.87-99.97 VII.

MB-EISE conceptual model Figure 3. Basic engineering tasks performed based on each cell-related view operability between methodologies applied within each cell can be accomplished. These tasks should be further re?ned within the limits of each Zachman cell Since, even within the purpose of a speci?c methodology or viewpoint, discrete issues may be resolved using autonomous, heterogeneous tools, tool integration related to a speci?c task should be supported. Some of them may employ their own internal model for EIS representation. Thus tool coordination and internal meta-model transformation should also be supported. According to model-based engineering principles, consistency is ensured, since the EIS view meta-model acts as a  reference point  Prior to using an existing tool, the partial transformation of view metamodel into the tool  s internal meta-model must be facilitated. Using this transformation, the invocation and initialization of any tool can be automatically performed 4. Model-Based Enterprise Information Systems Architecture Design To further elaborate on basic MB-EISE activity model re?nement and the proposed guidelines for constructing EIS cell-related view and the interaction with external cells, the System Network cell of the Zachman matrix is used as example According to INCOSE [16], determining system architecture \(i.e. the way autonomous system components should be synthesized tecture design is the process of de?ning and optimizing the architecture of the information system \(both hardware and software ing that all software components are identi?ed and properly allocated and that hardware resources can provide the 


erly allocated and that hardware resources can provide the desired performance. This activity is performed based on the EIS view corresponding to system network cell, which should facilitate: \(a e.g. a system-oriented view of distributed applications b nition of system performance and availability requirements c d platform-independent distributed infrastructure \(e.g. network architecture and hardware con?guration e ciation of software components to network nodes \(resource allocation requirements EIS architecture design was also discussed in [20]. In the following, we provide a methodology-independent, modelbased EIS enterprise design activity model and describe the corresponding EIS architecture design sub-views as well as Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 Figure 4. EIS Architecture Design basic engineering tasks way they are interrelated to external cells 4.1. First-level Description of EIS Architecture Design MB Activity The basic tasks identi?ed during the EIS architecture design activity are depicted in ?gure 4. These tasks are in alignment with basic engineering tasks performed for each Zachman matrix cell, as depicted in ?gure 3. Collect Requirements task \(as depicted in ?gure 3 through two discrete stages i.e. Functionality De?nition and Requirements De?nition within System Network cell The former depicts functional requirements extracted from People, Data and Function cells of the system model row The latter concerns non functional requirements related to EIS architecture design, extracted from the Motivation cell of System Model row. Requirements included in this cell are either propagated from the upper layers of Zachman framework or speci?cally de?ned for system design and may relate to issues not relevant to EIS architecture design Only architecture design related requirements are propagated within EIS System Network view Next, the solution is synthesized through two interactive steps i.e. Topology De?nition and Network Infrastructure De?nition \( [7], [12 source allocation and replication. This task is performed taken into account the de?nition of system access points in terms of hierarchically related locations performed in upper Network cells \(Business row network cell in particular The term site is used to characterize any location \(i.e. a building, an of?ce, etc tity which can be further analyzed into sub-sites, forming thus a hierarchical structure Network Infrastructure De?nition refers to the aggregate network, described through a hierarchical structure comprising LANs. Devices, such as servers and workstations Figure 5. EIS Sub-Views corresponding to the System Network cell are associated with LANs at the lowest level of the hierarchy. Network nodes are either workstations allocated to users or server stations running server processes. Topology and Network Infrastructure De?nition tasks are interrelated. Both should be performed in the same hierarchical levels of detail. At the lowest level, network nodes should be related to processes/data replicas. In essence, interaction between these two tasks represents an interdependence in terms of derived requirements. Requirements derived during Topology De?nition affect Network Infrastructure Definition and vice versa. Therefore, Requirements De?nition is performed in parallel with Topology and Network Infrastructure De?nition as well. Developing requirements and architectural artifacts in parallel has already been addressed in the literature [23 


in the literature [23 After the solution deployment, validation is performed using simulation. Solution evaluation will determine whether the overall process will end in case the solution is satis?ed or readjustments will be performed through the recurrence of the previous steps The tasks of ?gure 4 corresponding to Requirements Collection and Solution Synthesis \(which presented in ?gure 3 relative views are de?ned, namely, Functional View, Topology View, Network Infrastructure View and Requirements View. These views constitute sub-views of the SystemNetwork view of Zachman framework. Solution validation and evaluation is performed using information included in all of them. Interrelations between corresponding tasks are re?ected upon the introduced views. These interrelations along with the dependencies between the introduced views and the related models of the corresponding Zachman cells are depicted in ?gure 5. Dependencies with external Zachman cells are bidirectional. Functional view obviously is in?uenced by and in?uences People, Data and Function cells of System Model row, while Requirements view interacts with SystemMotivation view. Topology view is bidirectionally related to Business Network view, while Network Infrastructure view to Technology Network view System Network views are illustrated in ?gure 5 in a blackbox manner. A white-box perspective of them will unfold through the description provided in the following paraProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 graph, further elucidating view interdependencies 4.2. Meta-model describing System Network View The meta-model of System Network view, e.g. entities constituting each sub-view and their interrelations, is adjusted to support the identi?ed tasks As depicted in ?gure 6, Functional view encompasses functional requirements derived by external system cells. It focuses on functional speci?cations \(e.g. application architecture, user behavior and data structures considered to be based on multi-tiered, client-server models. Each application tier, called module, comprises services. Application tiers and provided services should be in accordance to the model de?ned in Function cell, thus they act as external entities. User behavior is modeled through roles de?ning the behavior of different user groups. They act as external entities for People cell \(e.g. they could be related to user role entities cate portions of data used by applications. They also act as external entities for Data cell. For each service, a service description sub-view is de?ned indicating network infrastructure resources needed for its execution. The load imposed to network infrastructure resources each time the service is executed is expressed using operations selected from a prede?ned set called Operation Dictionary [21]. Service Description and Operation Dictionary sub-views will be further described latter after discussing Requirements view Topology view facilitates allocation of software, data and people resources. It comprises sites, de?ned in upper Network cells, processes de?ned as instances of server or client modules, user pro?les as instances of roles, and data entity replicas as instances of data entities de?ned in Functional View. The allocation of them to sites corresponds to software architecture design. Sites are organized in a hierarchical structure. Those belonging to the lowest level of the hierarchy are characterized as atomic Network Infrastructure view comprises the overall network decomposed to sub-networks. Devices, such as servers, workstations and other network devices are associated with LANs at the lowest level of the hierarchy. Devices may include a processing unit and a storage unit Networks and network nodes are characterized by capac 


Networks and network nodes are characterized by capacity indications, for example throughput, storage speed or processing power, which should be matched with load requirements, related to Topology view entities. As a result networks are associated to sites de?ned in Topology view while processes, data entity replicas and user pro?les located in atomic sites are allocated to server or workstation devices included in the corresponding LAN Requirements view comprises non-functional requirements derived from the System Motivation cell relevant to EIS architecture design or progressively de?ned during the execution of the EIS Architecture Design tasks. Requirements de?ned within requirement view are satis?ed by speci?c entities included in Functional, Logical and Network Infrastructure views and contribute to inter-view interrelations. In the following we provide a further classi?cation of non-functional requirements based on our objectives in respect to EIS architecture design. Three main categories are supported: performance, constraint and speci?c quality [10 Regarding constraint requirements, we focus on those concerning capacity. Capacity, which has to do with the limitations of the hardware and their impact to the system is related to Network Infrastructure view. Regarding speci?c quality requirements, we consider only availability requirements. They are associated with Network Infrastructure view, where availability deals with hardware aspects Availability requirements may be either derived from upper level requirements, within System Motivation cell, or de?ned with System Network cell during EIS architecture design. Requirements de?ned within System Network cell during EIS architecture design should be passed to EIS System Motivation view As depicted in ?gure 6, performance requirements are further decomposed to behavior, load and utilization. Utilization requirements are associated with Network Infrastructure view and regard the proportion of network infrastructure resources used by applications during normal operation or extreme conditions. Behavior requirements deal with service behavior and are time-related \(e.g. response times 6. Load requirements concern the load imposed to EIS resources by system entities, as processes and data replicas de?ned in Topology view, for example average data transfer load or data processing load imposed by a speci?c process. These requirements are derived ones, which should be calculated for execution of each speci?c service based on behavior requirements and service decomposition described in Service Description sub-view The execution of each service relates to speci?c load requirements imposed to network infrastructure. To identify such requirements the amount of information processed stored or transferred during its execution should be estimated. The Service Description sub-view is introduced for this purpose, de?ned for each service included in Functional view. Since service functionality can be complex, it is not easily described in terms of the amount of information processed, stored or transferred during its execution. To facilitate the progressive estimation of load parameters, a set of operations are de?ned for the description of service load requirements [21].

EIS System Network View Meta-model operations are those used for service description and must be ultimately decomposed into elementary ones \(i.e. data processing, storing and transferring are estimated through parameter values that are propagated by service invocation parameters to parameters describing application operations constituting the service description which are further propagated to parameters describing elementary operations 4.3. EIS Architecture Design Task Implementation EIS Architecture Design tasks may be supported by existing tools [20]. Systems Modeling Language \(SysML 15] is considered as the most appropriate for EIS System Network model representation and requirement engineering, since it supports the concepts of requirements and resource allocation. As a direct consequence, SysML allows the representation of requirements as model elements which means that requirements are part of the system architecture. For representation purposes, a SysML pro?le for EIS System Network meta-model \(?gure 6 mented as a plugin to MagicDraw modeling tool [2]. In order to facilitate model exchangeability, EIS System Network model is being realized in XML, which is a standard exchangeable format. In order to exchange data with speci?c software tools, model transformations will be accomplished through appropriate XSLTs developed for each tool for example as the one transforming XMI to the EIS System Network document type description \(DTD 5. Case Study In the following we discuss the case of renovating a legacy information system supporting a large-scale public organization based on the proposed concepts. The organization supports more than 350 interconnected regional of?ces and its main purpose is to provide services to the public both citizens and businesses. Regional of?ces are divided into three categories according to their size and information infrastructure requirements \(large, medium and small More than 15.000 employees work in the organization having on-line access to the legacy system. There are more than 300 different services provided to the public, while each citizen is required to register in the one belonging to his/her residential area, called residential of?ce. Some of them require the actual presence of citizens in their residential of?ce Existing system architecture is based on a fat clientserver architecture. All application logic is programmed within the client platform, while data is distributed in local database servers located in each regional of?ce. A Central database is supported in the Datacenter for data synchronization and lookup purposes. The Datacenter and all regional of?ces participate in a private TCP/IP network to facilitate ef?cient data replication. Most data related to a speci?c citizen are maintained as local data in his/her residential of?ce. Client programs access the local database to store data, while they access the central database mostly for lookup purposes. Local data are asynchronously replicated in the central database using a transaction management system \(TMS Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 to facilitate communication with the central database. The central database provides the overall view of each citizen  s record 


record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description. This was crucial in order to decide upon Intranet and Datacenter architecture. This information was collected by interviewing software developers The new system has to deal with a number of require&lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Small Regional Office oracle L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt tuxido L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt L.R.O. department tuxido Central

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
