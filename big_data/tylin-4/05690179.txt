The Analysis of Factors Which Affect Dining Out Consumption of China Urban Residents 227\227Based on Provincial Panel Data Model Ruan Mianyu, Tai xiaohong  Liaoning Technical University  Huludao, China, 125105 E-mail: ruanmianyu@163.com, tai-xiaohong@163.com Abstract Paper firstly carries on the regional classifications to 31 provinces, municipalities and the autonomous zone in china, according to the amount and the height of growth rate of the urban residents\222 
Disposable income, and then analyzes the factors that affect dining out of each region urban residents through establishing the Panel Data Model. The analysis results indicate that the Notch Wheel Effect and disposable income are the most important factors that affect dining out of urban residents, and the influence has a big difference in the regions of different income levels, but the growth rate of the urban residents Disposable income has the minor impact on dining out of urban residents but also shows a positive correlation with the expense of dining out. At last, put forward the proposals separately from the demand of expanding domestic and 
development of catering enterprises angles based on the conclusions Key words urban residents; dining out; Panel Data model; notch wheel effect

  5 are parallel to the electric fiel d created by the bias voltage and thus the electrons and holes would be drifting directly through one and other.  In the case of tracks at some incident angle, the effect of the bias voltage electric field would be to expedite separation of the electrons and holes While the electronic satura tion effects causing the dip cannot be ruled out at this preliminary stage, Figure 5 gives an interesting additional perspective While both mechanisms may well be present, a single fortuitous event has been r ecorded where the acquisition time window happened to be open for only part of the Time-Over Threshold counting.  The event, shown in Figure 5 has a virtually complete lack of counts in the central-most region of the cluster.  While the TimePix can be setup on a pixel-by-pixel basis to function in a \223TDC\224 TimePix\mode, recording the number of clock pulses from the first threshold crossing after the \223Shutter\224 gate is open until it closes, this was not done for any of the data taking As such, it is not possible to tell whether the partial image resulted from an event that occurred prior to the Shutter opening, in which case only the last part of the discharging capacitor charge was recorded or the event occurred just before the shutter closed and only the initial charge on the capacitor was seen.  In the fo rmer case the event would be consistent with a saturation leakage mechanism, and in the latter case it could be an indica tion of a plasma-like effect although at this time we cannot exclude that it too could be an artifact of a saturation of the front-end electronics Future runs are planned to examine this phenomenon in greater detail and to provide guidance in designing future version of the circuits that will attempt to avoid these saturation issues  Figure 5.  Our so-called \223volcano event\224 is a cluster produced by a normally incident 500 MeV/A Fe beam particle during which the TimePix acquisition \223Shutter\224 was only open for part of the charge collection time The two possibilities are that the event started before the Shutter opened and only the tail end of the Time-OverThreshold counting was recorded, or the Shutter closed just after the start of the charge collection process  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The TimePix version of the Medipix technology shows significant promise to be of great use as a detector to characterize the space radiati on environment including the heavy ion components.  Measur ements made recently at the HIMAC Facility in Japan have indicated that there is a good prospect to develop algorithms that can parse the cluster shape information to distinguish individual charges and energies with reasonable resolution for dosimetry applications.  However, this running also produced data that indicate a saturation effect for the most heavily ionizing tracks that must be understood in order to guide modifications in future version of the technology 5  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  The provision of the beams by the National Institute for Radiological Sciences in Chiba, Japan is gratefully acknowledged.

 standardized information architecture and data told the chief architect from the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food. In this ministry they had detailed the entity map more and more all the way down to batch numbers for a single product from a specific producer In the Public Unit responsible for coherent digital healthcare in Denmark they were in the middle of the same kind of mapping. They had started trying to cope with registration of medicine in a unified way. The architect told that they aimed for one common medicine card for every citizen. The challenge being that every single system that uses medicine should have an interface to the card Another example that was brought up was from the Danish Maritime Authority. Here there was a large and well functioning system which all stakeholders were quite happy with. The chief architect s problem was that the IT-systems w a s a black box f o r ev er y bod y  in our organization also for the IT-department The system was running on old technology so it was destined to become obsolete So we had to dig it all up again That is really the driver today that we wanted to have an architectural overview the chief architect The Enterprise architect focus group was in agreement about the importance of different levels of architecture You need to have the architecture go from strategy to the operational as one of the architects expressed it However, the group also agreed that interoperability issues were most important for them. All of them spend the majority of their time looking at interrelationships of different applications, modeling and exchanging data. Going from strategy to the operational was seen as necessary, but none of the interviewees seemed to have a crystal clear understanding of this link between business and IT The business oriented approach that e.g. Garner promotes above was not something that the chief architects nor the CIO s were overly concerned with. It was clear that they did not see the major benefits in a business architecture that is more concerned with the business context than the structure of applications and data The CIO from Ministry of Foreign Affairs sees EA as a natural continuation of planning thinking  But something has changed he continues Today it is much more natural to involve IT from the beginning of a project. It is becoming natural to relate to the enterprise architecture we have  Another issue that was discussed in the focus group was how to implement EA so that people understand it We have tried to visualize our IT strategy. We have a number of small movie sequences [multimedia pod at can  sh o w  fu n c tio n a lit y told the CIO from the Danish Prison Service It needs to come from the top adds the CIO from the DMFA When the Director sends the first email, then the head of Department is forced to answer it doesn t help that an employee starts sending emails to the Head of Department; then nothing happens Later in the focus group discussion one Enterprise architect from a different organization confessed the major challenge is involving top management  At the end of our focus groups we discussed the how the public sector context influenced EA adoption and return on investment of EA. There was agreement around the table that the public sector was special in some ways. One thing mentioned was that not only profit was the goal. There were many criteria for good performance. Another thing mentioned was the high visibility The special thing about the public sector is that any failure gets trumpeted in the press said one CIO, and all agreed that the private sector could attract better people because they could give higher salaries Provoking a discussion with the chief architects about the business case especially the expected advantages it was interesting to see that none of the participants would stand up and claim the advantages to be fulfilled It may take 10 years to pay back as one Enterprise architect said. Another one emphasized that cooperation with users of the architectural standard was extremely important There is a need for someone testing it and giving you feedback as it was said  5  Discussion  Grounded in our empirical data and Abrahamson's theoretical framework, our analysis indicates that EA in government is to a large extend driven by fashion Interviews with the former public servant \(and now EA guru nd the Gartner director, indicate that EA was "chosen" as the appropriate tool to strengthen MSTI s influence on the e-government agenda. After publishing the EA white paper in 2003, the concept enjoyed almost instant fame and attracted tremendous managerial attention in the central government of Denmark, which in turn generated a transitory collective belief that EA was efficient, and at the forefront of best practice in IS planning The MSTI was successful in promoting technical interoperability challenges as so-called performance gaps  the difference between the performance level e-government managers aspire to and the level they actually achieve. EA was new and promised improving executive decisions and resource management Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 Governments produce White Papers, statements and booklets that provide best practice advice However, promotional documents do rarely give us a full and balanced picture of what is happening on the ground like any other public management reform [6   As our focus group interviews reveal EA is not very well understood in the central government of Denmark, and nothing indicates that it is generating administrative reforms in government that would replace traditional hierarchies with leaner structures Our analysis suggests that many of the local EA initiatives are partly initiated because of pressures of symbolic meanings \(social legitimacy\nd pressures to conform to commonly adopted target objectives such as efficiency and productivity gains of using EA planning. Backed by the promises of private and public success stories, we could say that MSTI supplied the EA fashion to the agencies in the Danish central government The CIO s and chief architects in our focus groups performed EA as a technical exercise that focuses on the interrelationships of different applications modeling and exchanging data and not so much the linking of business and IT. EA is perceived as something technical and administrative transformation is therefore not driven by EA planning in itself Our findings thus suggest an interesting distinction between two elements to EA in government: a stable element of IT-architecture and a fashion driven business architecture element. The two concepts are used in parallel, but they also have distinct differences in their focus, approach and use of artifacts. Table 3 describes these two seemingly different aspects of EA Our focus group participants were all comfortable when we discussed application integration, modeling and data exchange the IT-architecture. But, when we talked about the more high-level issues of applications and data in a business architecture context they were more skeptical. The external view of software that business architecture takes - focusing on business efficiencies and process transformation and not so much on the internal workings of applications - was not perused explicitly by any of our respondents. As one chief architect put it business architecture is something that we need to have to do EA, but we don t really do it today    Table 3: IT-architecture and business architecture IT Architecture Business architecture Focus Application interaction and systems development Business efficiencies and process transformation  Approach Documentation and analysis Business process management and change management Artifacts Logical and physical data models Technical standards, etc Business process diagrams investment business cases, etc  IT-architecture has its roots in the established software engineering discipline h ile bu sin e s s  architecture is a more recent phenomena  streams take a top-down approach to design interested in the interplay between different parts that form a whole. But, their artifacts and general purpose is different. IT-architecture can be viewed as the technical documentation and description necessary for traditional IS planning. While business architecture hosts the transformative element in EA the focus on business process management and change management that promises the modernization of government institutions Thus, EA has not been able to substitute the preexisting organizational IS-governance structures in the public agencies we studied. Institutionalized habits and values reinforce existing administrative and political arrangements, and pre-existing organizational structures for traditional IS planning seem to oppose the logics of EA planning As noted by op m a nag e rs i n  g o v e r n m e n t  agencies are rarely interested in organizational change and the EA planning innovation thus gets adopted to underpin the existing organizational structures. Thus our findings suggest, that it is unlikely that the development in the public sector IS planning will resemble the development in the private sector. Public sector planning is simply qualitatively different from planning in private enterprises or industries. As noted by ning re f o r m s ca n be driv e n b y dra m a t i c  higher profits, promotions, stock price increases, and market shares in the private sector, while this can be a showstopper in the public sector where effective IS planning most often will be rewarded with budget cuts staff reductions and loss of resources Finally, an interesting finding was also the confusing mandate of EA in the Danish government The governance setup gives the MSTI no power to force EA use. What really changes the way IS planning is performed in government is institutional change at the macro-level. The MSTI push for EA only caused Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


 incremental changes to the IS planning efforts in government entities. It was the External shocks  created by the Ministry of Financed that catalyzed the diffusion process \(cf. section 4.2\ in the Danish central government was supposed to guide administrative reforms, guide executive decisions, and improve recourse management. But, the transformation was a response to institutional change at the macrolevel, rather than the particular new template for IS planning in the organizations that we studied  6  Conclusion  Summing up our analysis and discussion, we found the causal direction reversed from EA being transformative and prescriptive in its nature to EA being reshaped and adopted in step with the institutional forces in public organizations and their macro environment As we have seen, IS planning innovations can change routines, structures and social values in government, but it must be understood in the context of the institutional forces that often resist dramatic changes. Public sector reforms will always be driven by political determination, while IS planning can be the enabling tool As for our research question on the purpose of EA and what has driven the use and adoption, our analysis indeed suggests that EA in government to a large extend is characterized by fashions. The EA concept is ambiguous and lacks commonly accepted definitions Our focus group interviews revealed two elements to EA in government: a stable element of it-architecture and a fashion driven business architecture element. As we have seen it seems that the formation and adoption of EA in government is driven by compliance with central guidelines and imitation of best practice  The hyperbole surrounding government modernization and transformation thought the adoption of EA planning seem to be epochal. An epochal schema of old style bureaucratic IS planning and the new EA planning agenda has considerable intuitive appeal. But our findings illustrate how individual circumstances cannot just be considered invisible or rendered insignificant. Organizational context imitation and compliance explain adoption patterns better than a universal and invariable recipe of management procedures and techniques like EA. Thus our conclusion is that EA can not transform government by itself.  Fundamental transformation to the tasks performed in organizations is only achieved if the institutional force promotes transformation  6.1. The future of EA in government  The limitation of fashion theory is its weak explanatory power. Using Abrahamson s theory [20 21  w e c a n no t  sa y ho w  l o n g a fa sh i o n l i ke E A  w i l l  stay fashionable in government or even how long it will take to become unfashionable again However, by emphasizing how EA adoption and use is not produced solely by the aggregation of individual and organizational reform agendas but by institutions that structure action, the institutional perspective offers a vantage point for understanding EA planning in government. Our findings points out how EA is not a clear-cut cure that can be adopted by any public organization with similar results. EA implementation must be understood in the organizational context it is implemented in Working with many different stakeholders, both leadership and subject matter experts, to build a holistic view of the organization's strategy, processes information, and technology assets must not be underestimated in government EA programs. Public servants and their consultants must understand the business of government and the business of their own organizations before they engage in EA To be more than just another fashion fad, future EA programs in government must provide a comprehensive and coherent view across business information, and technology; not just to guide the design of IT systems but to deliver business change supported and enabled by IT  References  1  OECD \(2005 OECD Peer Review of e-Government in Denmark www.oecd.org, last accessed June 2008    2  Hite, R. \(2003 Information Technology: A framework for assessing and improving enterprise architecture management Version 1.1\.

  11  Figure 16 \226 The loss of spat ial resolution for errors in p    The spatial distribution of th e reconstructed images is illustrated in Figure 17 for p 0.5\260 and 400nm, 425nm and 450nm As expected, the larger dispersion at the shorter wavelengths will cause a larger shif t error.  In fact, as shown in Fig. 17 the error radius can become so large that we again see donuts as point response functions in the reconstruction Final Comments Specific systematic sources of error have been presented in this section independently Obviously it is a combination these errors that will propaga te through the transform to give the final result in terms of resolution and displacement in the reconstructed hyperspectral data set.  The contribution of each systematic error source in terms of the derived r   p  or  x\222 y\222 representation can be used to create an error kernel for each given in Equations 10 and 11 multiplied in series in Fourier space or convolved in series in the spatial domain to evaluate the cumulative effect  3  C OMPARISON TO M EASUREMENTS  The effect and sensitivity of th e selected systematic errors have been shown given the mathematical models for projection and reconstruction.  Data taken from the AFIT CTI instrument will be examined to determine how well the model is capturing the modeled impact of the systematic error with controlled in strumental inaccuracies Data Collection and Analysis An effective point source will be the target for the system and is represented by a 300 m pinhole at the object plane illuminated by a combination of an Hg pen lamp and red laser pointer.  This provid es 5 clear lines at 404.7nm 435.8nm, 546nm, 577.5nm, and 635nm 5 with the first four being from the pen lamp.   Care is taken here to not suggest that this is a true validation of the model, as it is impossible to completely isolate the effect of a single source of error Furthermore, the instrument was not designed with the exact measurement of quan tities such as detector tilt or prism alignment in mind, so these qu antities have to be measured indirectly. An attempt is made to make the particular error in question gross enough to be the overwhelming contributor and variation du e to possible inaccuracy in measurement is included in the model For each instance of induced systematic error in the instrument, projections will be taken at p 0\260-345 1 5 260 increments to provide a total of 23 projections.  This data will not be reconstructed usin g the SAA algorithm as that will serve to compound the contribution of unaccounted error.  Instead, a direct comparison to the derived r   p  will be made in each case.  In assessing the model vs performance, trends in this da ta will be consid ered in favor of absolute difference.  The measurements made address effect of detector tilt and di stance error, accuracy of the dependence of p   on I and error from prism misalignment.  For the this co llected data, a correction will be made to better calibrate the system to the actual p   to avoid the spectral shift in the data Variation in Detector Array Tilt and Distance To measure the affect that til t has on the collected data, the PIMAX camera was slightly ro tated from its position to create an angle between the detector array and the normal to the optical axis as shown in Figure 6.  Because the camera was rotated about its mount point, which is displaced from detector by 70 mm, the rotation angle also  5 The 577.5 line is the average of the Hg doublet that appears here and not clearly resolved by the instrument nm Spatial Res. \(pixels 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 p = 0.10\260 p = 0.25\260 p = 0.50\260  Figure 17 \226 The 400 nm, 425 nm, and 450 nm spatial functions for p 0.5\260.

The camera was moved toward L 3  by 2mm d 2mm corporating the variable distance imparted by the camera sw ivel.  It is estimated that the tilt angle of the camera can be measured to +/- 0.25\260 and that the error in from both components\within 0.5mm.  These measurement er ror estimations will be used in the model to determine a maximum and minimum range of model results.  Equation 13 will be used to calculate r   p  the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle.  For the 404.7nm source, the image was projected off of the array at p 140\260 - 200\260 thus the gap in data.  The results are shown in Figs. 18-22   Figure 18 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 404.7nm spectral line   Figure 19\226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 435.8nm spectral line   Figure 20 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 546nm spectral line   Figure 21 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 577.5nm spectral line   Figure 22 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 635nm spectral line   The data imply that the overall mean value of r   p  is being captured which represents the contribution of The shapes of the curves appear to match somewhat for the 404nm and 435nm cases, but the correlation for the other three wavelengths is not as cl ose.  For these wavelengths the variation in r   p  as a function of p is very small possibly due to other uncontrolled error.  Also, for these and all spatial location measurements, there is inherent quantization error in determinin g the center of the Gaussian fit function due to the phasing of the samples on the array 6  Change in p  as a Function of I  A major impact on the reconstr uction algorithm is the error in estimation of the prism dispersion angle p   due to the difference in assumed and true values of the incident angle to the prism I This drives the observed error as a result of prism misalignment, as well as the correction needed in the reconstruction to account for fiel d angle.

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship.
