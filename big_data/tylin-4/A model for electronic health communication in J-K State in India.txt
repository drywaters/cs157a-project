systems catered to specialist departments and are usually best-in-class systems for the specific department but not across an enterprise This created a huge Challenge in presenting the data in these disparate systems as a single unit The introduction of the Integrated Healthcare Delivery Networks and moving beyond the single episode of care in a single enterprise to the entire continuum of care in multiple enterprises generated the need for availability of information as a single entity Economies world-wide have also started to realize the burgeoning costs of providing healthcare to its population Several studies support the fact that the availability of correct data at the point of care reduces the patient's costs to a large extent Real-time messaging between clinical systems did solve the problem of data being available at the right time to some extent but it did not solve the problem of presenting data available in disparate systems as a single unit II PRESENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE J&K STATE The J&K State is having population more than one crore and covers an area of approximately 2,22,236 sq Kms districts for administration and carrying out developmental programmes Maximum part of the state is hilly and topography of the state comes in the way of developing adequate infrastructure and is further compounded by terrorism and militancy J&K State has two capital cities namely Jammu and Srinagar and having population more than one crore and covers an area of approximately 2,22,236 sq Kms The state is divided into three regions namely Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh and further subdivided into 22 districts with 3.48 population below poverty line of the state The total number of villages in the state is 7257 and blocks is 135 Most of the area of the state is hilly and not connected with the rail network Topography of the State comes in the way of developing adequate infrastructure and is further compounded by terrorism and militancy which have taken a heavy toll of life and public property besides throwing normal life out of gear In some districts like Kargil and Leh the roads remain closed for almost six months of the winter season Other districts like Doda Kishtwar Poonch of Jammu division and almost all the districts of Kashmir Division get heavy snow fall and roads remain closed on a number of occasions and situation always remains concerned for health care system of the state for handling patients under these circumstances All the main hospitals are located at Jammu or Srinagar cities being capital cities of the State The details of main Health institutions in brief are given below Medical colleges 4 District Hospitals 14 Ayurvedic Hospitals 2 Ayurvedic Dispensaries 265 Unani Hospitals 3 Unani Dispensaries 235 Sub Centres\(SCs 1888 Primary Health Centres 374 Community Health Centres 80 Following table shows the total population Crude Birth Rate Crude Death Rate Total Fertility Rate Infant Mortality Rate below represents female literacy rate and population Below Poverty Line in the state v/s India In the present system not even a single hospital in the state is equipped with proper ICT facilities The state is facing the basic problem to bring all these main hospitals under one umbrella People in the system don  t seem to know much about the utilization of ICT in health care and there is no concept of resource sharing at present All the health centres from main state level hospitals to sub centres are functioning as single III DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data has been collected from different sources through observation method personal interviews and through questionnaire A questionnaire was prepared and distributed in different areas of the state The graphs below show the opinion of the people about various aspects of the Health Care system in the state The following observations were made A Availability of Health Care Centre As per the observations most of the people in the state are dependent upon the SCs and PHCs for treatment and very few enjoy the facilities of main stream hospitals Only 5.4 and 2.7 people from the state undergo treatment in the Ayurvedic and Unani hospitals and dispensaries

This gives rise to both symmetry of knowledge and an insufficient inter organizational integration 6  A Planning and implementation The aim of the project is the study of Health care system in J&K State and possible improvement in system by using ICT and ICT tools particularly Govt Health Institutions which covers the major areas of the State and provide medical support almost free of cost The proposed electronic health communication model is like the waterfall model in which the next phase will not be initiated unless the previous phase gets fully completed Overall networking is the key features of the model B Phase I a Creating Remote Consultation Centres  Since the maximum population is residing in remote villages connected by improper roads Telemedicine method of operation can serve as a strong bone to the Health Care System Patients particularly living in rural areas need medical advice for proper medical treatment and they don  t find an equipped health centre very nearby fail to take any decision in crucial moments A patient rushed to nearest primary health centre can be taken care of even by an RMP by making a simple consultation with experts sitting in the network if these primary health centres are equipped with ICT facilities As internet has approached to every remote area of the country proper infrastructure can be set to make some of the primary health centres ICT enabled and to call them as Remote Consultation Centre RCC These RCCs are intended to serve the maximum population residing in remote villages connected by improper roads by providing consultation which in turn will help them in decision making for right kind of treatment In its primary stage it doesn  t involve lot of efforts manpower and budget and the stations could be established with minimum efforts and very few hurdles RCCs in State should be connected to District health level centres or district hospitals which contains a group consisting of one to two experts with other staff available for expert opinion to the queries received from their subsequent RCCs These experts from district level centres hospitals will also have links with different experts of the system as per schedule for any kind of assistance as and when required They can seek a opinion from a specialist from any other hospital in the network if needed b Managing Patient and Doctors  Data A medical portal in the form of Electronic Health Record EHR has to be developed which will record the patient data completely from the admission to till being relieved The system will be initially stand alone at all levels The system will be effective later on when the phase of Networking will be carried out At the admission of the patient the software will take care of patient data A unique Patient  s Identification Number PIN will be allotted to each patient in Out Patient Department OPD\ergency as the case may be which will also indicate to identity of the health centre where received In the similar way the Doctors database will also be made the part of the portal C Phase II a Making all govt. health centers ICT enabled and networking of RCCs and health centers Through online communication the patient related opinion can be obtained resources can be shared and above all the burden on lower level hospitals can be eased At this stage it is presumed that RCC are completely functional now A Doctor from a sub distri ct hospital can send all the parameters available to an expert for special opinion The query can be posed through one RCC to the other RCC up to district level The district level RCC can forward the query to concerned specialist and collect the feed back The query can be directly replied by the doctor or through RCC Video conferencing can be used to watch the patient on the digital monitors and have discussion with each other and decide the treatment D Phase III a Networking of all important Priva te Hospitals Charitable Health Centres, Private Blood Ba nks, Pathology and Radio diagnostic Labs However to begin with only the well known health centers and institutions which are functioning under Govt license should be covered in the proposal Requests as and Phase III  Networking of all important Private Hospitals Charitable Health Centr es, Private Blood Banks Pathology and Radio diagnostic Labs Making all govt health centers ICT enabled and networking of RCCs and health centers Managing Patient and Doctors Data Creating Remote Cons ultation Centres Phase II Phase I 
 


when necessary will be made within the terms and conditions of MOU E.g the private hospitals may seek opinions from the senior doctors of the hospital through RCC unit On the other hand Govt Hospitals would like to send the blood samples of a patient for cross examination and confirmation of results Similarly a private agency can arrange blood for the Govt Hospital and provide ambulance and other manpower support as and when required The development of this proposed system can be made effective with the help of one central agency which will prepare a common data Bank of all the health institutions Nursing Homes Private clinics etc out of which some can serve as service centre for RCC and will be online with different Hospitals and will have access to their reception/registration counters Similarly the private clinic doctors who desire to be in the net should also be linked Different HPBs will be established at various places in the state V FUTURE SCOPE The proposed system has touched almost all the issues pertaining to ICT in Health Care System All the issues pointed out have a scope of detailed study and can serve as a model for any other state and system More data can be collected on similar lines and analyzed to get a clearer picture The proposal is designed in such a way that different teams can be involved and given separate jobs which will be almost independent of each other VI CONCLUSION Jammu and Kashmir State is making progress in the health sector very slowly The remote areas which remain cutoff during the winter session needs to be addressed The people of the state have limited knowledge of the use of IT/ICT in the Health Care System Even the Doctors and paramedical staff engaged for saving the precious lives are ignorant about the technology and its role in improving Health Care System There is a great need of improvement in the existing Health Care Structure of the state particularly in relation to the use of ICT in the system The new techniques in the field of Health system due to introduction of ICT like e-health telemedicine and other ways of resource sharing would be highly beneficial for the people of these areas A new system has been proposed which recommends the implementation of the system in phases It is always desirable to carry out the projects in phases the proposed system has been divided into five different phases Main emphasis has been given on the establishment of Remote Consultation Centres RCC which are mainly targeted for rural areas of the state Networking of all the health institutions has been proposed upto the Sub Centre level and to the process has been split into different phases keeping in view the present position of Health sector in the state and the requirement of finance manpower technology and time The proposed system has touched almost all the issues pertaining to ICT in Health Care System All the issues pointed out have a scope of detailed study and can serve as a model for any other state and system More data can be collected on similar lines and anal yzed to get a clearer picture The proposal is designed in such a way that different teams can be involved and given separate jobs which will be almost independent of each other VII REFERENCES 1 Nils-Goran Olve & Vivian Vimarlund Linkoping University  Elderly Healthcare, Collaborat ion and ICT - enabling the Benefits of an enabling Technology  VINNOVA Report VR 2006:05 2 S.Bedi Senior Director Head M ed.Electronics Telemedicine Department of Information Technology Government of India  National initiat ives in Health Care using ICT   3 M etin Akay A nd y M arsh, In formation Technologies in Medicine, Volume I: Medical Simulation and Education Copyright \( 2001 John Wiley & Sons Inc 4 National Rural Health m issi on; Govt of J&K District Health Action Plan Web site http://jknrhm.com  index.html M/O Health  F.W GOI RHS bulletin March 2007 5 National Rural Health M ission M ission D ocu m e n t ;20052012 6 Vibhakar M ansotra, Dalip Ku m a r B hat  A study of ICT penetration in Health Care System for J&K State  INDIACom 2009

   9 The imaging payload field of view and field of regard are used by the mission modeling capabilities to determine feature of interest access and coverage metrics 5  COTS  SPS  P ROTOTYPING  Figure 6 is an overview of the prototype work flow functionality needed for a COTS implementation of the GetCapabilities, DescribeTasking, and GetFeasibility operations of an SPS Data exchanges between a User and an SPS are specified by a schema.  The prototype em ploys Spacecraft Capabilities Tasking Definition, and Acquisition Feasibility schema They are not intended to be one-off versions of the GetCapabilities, DescribeTasking, and GetFeasibility schema.  They are sparse schemas that support the design of the data exchanges needed for employing AGI mission modeling capabilities The sparse schema is used for the first prototyping steps The schema will be brought in to compliance with the SPS Implementation Specification in the final steps of prototyping SpacecraftCapabilities The Spacecraft Capabilities Reque st schema, illustrated in Figure 6, consists of Country and Payload Type elements These are the elements define d in the spacecraft schema\222s Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operations elements If the User does not specify a country, the search will include all countries.  The Payload Type can be Optical Imager or Radar Imager.  If a Payload Type is not specified the search will include both imagers The User populates the Spacecraft Capabilities Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed.  The PoC-SPS searches and retrieves Spacecraft Classification and Pa yload Operation data from the SOC, populates the Sp acecraft Capabilities Response XML document, and sends it to the User AcquisitionFeasibility The User receives and pars es the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document and selects the applicable spacecraft and imaging payloads.  The User populates the Acquisition Feasibility Request XML document and sends it to the PoC-SPS where it is received and parsed The Acquisition Feasibility Request schema, illustrated in Figure 6, contains Spacecraft Pa yload Pairing, Feature of Interest, and Acquisition Constraints The request also includes the radar scan mode from Radar Payload Operation element if th e imager is a Radar Imager A Feature of Interest is defined by a ground point A full set of acquisition constraints includes geometric temporal, environmental, and quality. Examples of acquisition constraints for an Op tical Imager are: geometric slant range elevation angle range, temporal - time of day interval, environmental - solar elevation angle range, and quality - ground sample resolution range The PoC-SPS does not incorporate ground sample resolution since it requires knowledge of the detector configuration.  For example, an optical detector would require, at a minimum, detector focal length and pixel width.  However, a User can select an imaging payload based on its ground sample resolution provided in the Spacecraft Capabilities Response XML document The PoC-SPS receives and processes the Acquisition Feasibility Request.  The spacecraft payload pairing is used to retrieve the payload field of regard from the SOC and the spacecraft orbital elements from CelesTrak, the authoritative source of NORAD or bital elements.  Then the AGI Components are activated to determine the Acquisition Feasibility Response The payload field of regard is used instead of the field of view because it corresponds to the in-track and cross-track range that the payload could be pointed The Acquisition Feasibility Response sequence contains a number of acquisition interval start and stop times and corresponding acquis ition geometry The PoC-SPS populates the AcquisitionFeasibilityResponse XML document and provides it to the User The User can request Acquisition Feasibility Responses from a number of potential DPs and select the DP that best satisfies the User needs 6  F IRE S AT S YS ML   AGI  C OMPONENTS I NTERFACE P ROTOTYPING  The interaction between the SPS operations and AGI Components is the basis of the interaction between a FireSat SysML model and AGI Components SysML is a domain-specific modeling language for systems engineering.

   11 The SysML model is of a hypothetical FireSat system - a space-based system for det ecting, identifying, and monitoring forest fires.   It is derived from the description in Space Mission Analysis and Design Third Edition, by Wiley J. Larson and James R. Wertz \(editors modeling is an International Council of Systems Engineering \(INCOSE\odel Based System Engineering MBSE\ilot project One of the goals of the FireSat MBSE pilot project is to develop an interface between the FireSat SysML model and STK/AGI Components The FireSat system consists of users, mission satellites communications satellites, and ground stations.  The SysML model is used to carryout trade studies of system design performance, and cost   The FireSat SysML model is created with MagicDraw 256  from No Magic and uses ParaMagic\231 from InterCAX to carry out trade studies.  Para Magic integrates Microsoft Excel, MATLAB 256 Simulink 256 and Mathematica into MagicDraw SysML models.  InterCAX is prototyping the SysML interface with AGI Components Figure 7 is an overview of how a FireSat SysML model could interact with AGI Components to carry out trade studies on FireSat system elements There are two types of interactions.  The first is a setup of the scenario elements cache c ontaining candidate spacecraft imaging payloads, relays, and ground stations.  These candidate elements are populated from the FireSat system elements pool.  This pool contains all of the FireSat elements and variations under consideration. The second interaction is a series of elements selections, accessibility queries, and coverage queries The accessibility and coverage data returned by AGI Components are used to assess FireSat measures of effectiveness.  Examples ar e area covered, revisit time memory margin, and power margin The accessibility and coverage data are also used to assess FireSat resource usage strategies, e.g 
200  Communication link availability for command uplink telemetry downlink, and image downlink 200  Memory used for image storage versus memory freed up by downlink during and after imaging 200  Power used for image collection and downlink versus power replenished during sunbathing and normal operations The current prototyping of the interaction between the FireSat SysML model and AGI Components is confined to the data exchange interface of Figure 8 200  Scenario Elements Initialization 200  Accessibility Chain Request and Response 200  Feature Coverage Request and Response The spacecraft orbit is modeled w ith the standard set of six orbital elements.  The imaging payload is modeled with rectangular or conic field of view half angles and a direction of pointing in the spacecraft re ference frame.  The field of view is modeled, instead of the field of regard, since it represents the extent of the coverage capability at any instance of time. The field of regard represents the potential coverage Accessibility chains are used to determine time intervals of accessibility through a string of serially linked scenario elements As an example, take a chain consisting of a feature of interest, a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station.  The chain capability determines the intervals of time that the missi on spacecraft is in view of the feature of interest and the rela y and, at the same time, the relay is in view of the ground station.  In view means that the lines of sights between th e elements satisfy viewing constraints A feature of interest, an imaging payload on a mission spacecraft, a relay spacecraft, and a ground station chain is more restrictive since line of si ght to the feature of interest must be within the imaging payload field of view. The satellite can image the feature of interest and downlink the image through the relay satellite during these intervals of time The feature of interest can be a point or an area.  An area is defined by a set of latitude, longitude, and altitude vertices connected by straight lines.  The AGI Components coverage capability fills in the area with grid points with a user defined spacing The user also selects among the following figure of merits for area coverage 200  Area covered, i.e. square kilometers 200  Percent of area covered 200  Area covered in each time interval 200  Minimum, maximum, and average response times 200  Minimum, maximum, and average revisit times 
 


   12 The response time is a measure of the time between a request for coverage of an area grid point and the time at which coverage is achieved The revisit time is a measure of the intervals during which coverage of a grid point is not provided, also known as coverage gaps 7  C URRENT S TATUS AND F UTURE P LANS  The SOC is currently populated with Earth observation navigation, communications and technology development spacecraft as well as ground facilities that support spacecraft launch and operations The SOC contains 59 Earth observation satellites from 20 countries.  There are 44 optical imaging satellites with a total of 116 operating modes, and 15 radar imaging satellites with a total of 66 operating modes.  An optical operating mode is a combination of sensor, spectrum projected field of view, and ground resolution.  Examples of radar operation modes are spotlight, stripmap, and scanSAR The schema has been defined for the User - PoC-SPS data exchange of Figure 6 and the Discover Sensors capability has been prototyped as A pplication Programming Interface API\e next step is to prototype all the capabilities as both as API and XML document interfaces Then, the XML document inte rface will be brought into compliance with the SPS Impl ementation Specification The prototyping of FireSat SysML and AGI Components interaction is taking place in geographically separated facilities: AGI in Exton, Pennsylvania and InterCAX in Atlanta, Georgia.  XML documents were exchanged by email during the initial prototyping.  Current prototyping incorporates program-to-program automatic exchange of XML documents, with all the prototyping at InterCAX Future prototyping will include an API passing of data The InterCAX approach to the design and implementation of FireSat SysML model and AGI Components interaction is addressed in reference 2 Figure 7.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
