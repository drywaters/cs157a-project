Acoustic emission \(AE good method to monitor HIC. In order to investigate the characteristic of AE signals pr 
oduced by HIC of carbon steel used in pressure vessel, the hydrogen charging progress of 20R steel was monitored using AE technique. There were three useful AE sources during the test, corrosion and charging, FeS film forming and breaking, and HIC growth, which all can be detected through AE instrument. The amount of big amplitude AE signals were increased obviously with cracking growth and microscopic examinations provided good confirmation. The peak frequency ranges of these three kinds of AE waveform signals were similar, but their distribution of the spectrum magnitude to the corresponding frequency were different and can be used as 
the discriminating acoustic parameters.Therefore, a pattern recognition method based on frequency feature extraction, fisher ratio and trained back-propagation \(BP\ network was developed for the sources\222 signals class deci sion.

Acoustic emission \(AE\ technique is an effective method for monitoring dynamic damage progress, which has been applied to pressure vessel test more than 40 years since Dunegan carried out the first AE test for pressure vessel in 1963 A l t h o ugh i t i s w i d e l y use d t o pr e ssu r e ve sse l t e s t i n  many countries [2-5  it isn 222 t k n o w n  w h eth e r A E  is ef f ectiv e to  monitor hydrogen induced cracking \(HIC\ of pressure vessel made by carbon steel. Very few papers were found studied the acoustic emission of HIC of carbon steel through literature searches. O.E.Andreikiv applied AE to monitor the extending process of 9KhF and 4340 steel specimen exposed to 0.1MPa

In order to search AE testing method for HIC in pressure vessel, this paper investigated AE characteristics of HIC of 20R carbon steel frequently used by pressure vessel in China II  T EST M ETHOD  A 
 Specimen Due to 20R steel is popularly used for pressure vessel in China, it was selected for testing. Fig. 1 showed the shape of the specimen. The thickness of specimen was 12mm. After mechanically polished, the specimen was protected by epoxy resin. An area with diameter 2mm were polished with emery paper number 800 for charging hydrogen atom. Table I listed the chemical composition and mechanical properties B  Experimental Device Fig.1 showed the experimental device. H 2 S gas was keeping filled into distilled water in an aquarium during the 
test. The specimen was as the cathode and platinum electrode as the anode. The specimen can be charged hydrogen atom by electrolysis with constant current supply. The specimen was monitored by an AE instrument during the electrolysis. The AE instrument was model AMSY-5 made by Vallen. A broad brand AE sensor with response frequencies 100kHz 900kHz was used. The gain of pre-amplifier was 40dB. The sample rate of AE waveform signals was 5 MHz, and sample point was 8192 Figure 1  Experimental device 1

III  AE MONITORING RESULT  Before electrifying to the specimen, the background noise was collected. The amplitudes of background noise signals were lower than 35dB. The frequency scope of background noise signal was very wide in Fig. 2 After electrifying, AE signals of amplitudes between 35dB and 45dB were immediately detected. These kinds of AE signals were called class A. Four hours later, AE signals of amplitudes between 45dB and 65dB emerged as shown in Fig 3. These kinds of AE signals were called class B. After persisting 15 minutes, class B AE signals stopped. About 3 hours later, model B AE signals appeared again Class A and B mixed after testing 20 hours. About continuously monitoring 3 days later, bigger amplitudes of AE signals between 60dB and 75dB emerged. These kinds of AE signals were called Class C. After persisting 10 minutes, Class C AE signals stopped. About 1.5 hours later, it appeared again as shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 5 003\032 Fig. 7 were the wave and frequency distribution figures of three classes signals. The peak frequency of three kinds of AE signals were all located in 80 003\032 180kHz. Their peak frequencies were obviously different from that of background noise. At the same time, their amplitudes of frequency below 50kHz and above 700kHz were close to zero But the amplitudes of different class signals were not alike Amplitude\(mV Time 002\035 s Amplitude\(mV  Frequency \(kHz Figure 2  Wave and frequency of background noise Amplitude\(dB  Time \(s Figure 3  Amplitude of AE signals  versus charging time at early stage TABLE I  C HEMICAL COMPOSITION AND  MECHANICAL PROPERTIES  OF STEEL SAMPLES  20R Steel  Chemical composition \(mass fraction  0.18C 0.48Mn 0.17Si 0.035S 0.028P Mechanical properties  0011 b MPa 450 0011 s MPa 240 001 5  25  Amplitude\(dB Time \(s Figure 4  Amplitude of AE signals versus charging time  at later stage Amplitude\(mV  Time 002\035 s Amplitude\(mV  Frequency \(kHz Figure 5  Wave and frequency of class A signals Amplitude\(mV Time 002\035 s Amplitude\(mV Frequency \(kHz Figure 6  Wave and frequency of class B signals 
 


IV  A NALYSIS OF TESTING RESULT  AE signals of Class A were immediately produced when started electrifying. It illuminated that the signals were directly produced by the corrosion of H 2 S solution and the process electrifying to charge hydrogen atom. It existed throughout the testing process. According to two specimens, it was found that class B signals always emerged after electrifying several hours Observing the corrosive surface of specimen by electron microscope, it was found that there was a layer of FeS with many cracks on the surface as in Fig. 8. Due to HIC was not found inside of the specimen by electron microscope, this illuminated that class B signals were produced by cracking and flaking off of FeS layer After class C signals emerged, the experiment was terminated for another specimen. It was found that there were many blisters with diameter of 0.2mm~4.5mm on the corrosive surface as in Fig. 9. Some blisters had burst and the metallograph of the specimen was observed as shown in Fig 10. This illuminated that class C signals were produced by HIC Amplitude\(dB Time s Amplitude\(mV  Frequency \(kHz Figure 7  Wave and frequency of class C signals  Figure 8  Micrograph of FeS layer on specimen surface  Figure 9  Photograph of the specimen surface mm  Figure 10  Metallograph of hydrogen blister 100 V  P ATTERN RECOGNITION OF TESTING RESULT  As it is discussed in section and four AE sources occurred in the test, which were class A \(corrosion and charging\, class B \(cracking and flaking off of FeS layer\, class C \(hydrogen blister development\ and class D \(background noise\. In order to associate similar types of waveforms into individual classes, pattern recognition method was used Firstly, it found the features of highest discrimination quality with separate waveforms of four sources signals. Then, the features were used to efficient separate signals into classes A  Feature Extraction Some representative waveforms for each class were chosen as examples to get information out of individual AE signals For each amplitude-time series with 8192 sample points, 10 MHz sample rate, thirteen Hamming windows function were applied and the FFT calculated. The Hamming windows each with 1024 sample points, and an interesting frequency range of 50 - 700 kHz, suppressed the information close to its start and end. To avoid this suppression of information the time windows overlapped. This was shown in Fig. 11. Then, the following was obtained: The 1024 sample points resulted in 512 frequency points per time window covering the frequency range 0 to 5MHz \(half the sampling rate\. The frequency points were 9.76kHz apart \(5MHz/512\nd the first frequency point of the spectrum was at 4.88kHz \(9.76kHz/2\. The first frequency point that fell in the selected frequency range of interest was at 53.68kHz \(4.88 + 5 9.76\; this became the first feature of the time window. The last feature of the time window got the number 67 and fell in 697.84kHz \(66 9.76 53.68\. The features 1 to 67 described the spectrum of the first time window, the features 68 to 134 the second time window etc, and the features 805 to 871 described the spectrum of the 13th and last time window. All 67 features of each time window were displayed in the Fig. 13. The normalization factor is added as feature 872. Each spectrum point was used as a feature" whose value was the magnitude of the spectrum of the corresponding frequency The 872 features can be interpreted as the dimensions of a multidimensional space. Each waveform was represented by a point in this space. Some features of different classes have the similar value or are lowly significant. Such parameters \(data features\only complicate the recognition problem. In order to reduce feature redundancy, the fisher ratio was used to help find the features of highest discrimination quality and to use them for efficient separation of classes. The fisher ratio was used as an indicator for the discriminative quality of a specific feature according to certain classes. Then 60 specific features 
 


were selected for transformation that was highlighted. The following was obtained in Fig.12 The back-propagation artificial neural network was designed to be a classifier as input 60 selected features and four classes as output one. Then, the network was trained to place each representative wave within its own class B  Classification Results The method was applied to 71 sets of data from the test The good predicting result was in Table II. The predicting correctness of class D was the  best among the four classes The other three ones were all below 80%. The error between class B and C was bigger. It showed that to some degree class B and C have the similar orientations because  class B was partly from the gestation of HIC. However, the pattern recognition method is still a reliable tool for identifying different classes VI  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, 20R steel plate specimen was exposed to a H 2 S-saturated aqueous solution for hydrogen charging 6 days After the test, many hydrogen blisters and hydrogen induced cracklings was found in the steel. The following conclusions can be drawn Acoustic emission testing is an effective method to monitor HIC and corrosion for carbon steel All available AE signals can be divided into three classes, class A, B and C, which stand for three different AE sources Model A with amplitude between 36dB to 52dB responded to corrosion of solution and process electrifying to charge hydrogen atom. The forming and breaking of FeS film by corrosion or the crack initiation may be the reasons caused model B, whose amplitude ranged from 52dB to 72dB. Model C has the highest amplitude of 72dB to 75dB, and it should attribute to the HIC extending TABLE II  C ORRECTNESS RATE OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA BY BP NETWORK  Class Training samples Class name Correctness of predicting A B C D A 20 15 1 1 0 75.0 B 20 1 16 3 0 80.0 C 20 0 2 15 0 75.0 D 11 0 1 0 10 90.9 Amplitude\(mV Frequency \(kHz Figure 11  Hamming window analysis on wave signals of AE sources Time segment s All features Selected features Frequency segment\(kHz Figure 12  Wave and frequency of class C signals Metallographic study is a good evidence to show the links between AE activity and the HIC progress The peak frequency of three kinds of AE signals were all located in 80 180kHz, but their amplitudes were different Therefore, the magnitude of the spectrum of the corresponding frequency can be used as the discriminating acoustic parameters. Through fisher ratio, resulting optimized AEsignal-feature set provides the maximal information with minimized number of selected AE signal parameters \(selected features The pattern identification method based on frequencytime series, fisher ratio and BP network is proven to be an effective one for AE waveforms A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We are indebted to the Hebei Supervision & Inspection Institute of Boiler & Pressure Vessel for laboratory support and to Dr. Wu Zhan-wen for technical assistance R EFERENCES  1  H.

4. Local Case Study Analysis: Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN  Researchers conducted a case study of the local Rochester Minnesota Mayo Clinic trauma information system in Olmsted County, Minnesota between March 2007 and January 2008. The Mayo Clinic service area is largely rural, covering a land mass that includes portions of three states southeastern Minnesota, western Wisconsin, and northeastern Iowa and the population of the communities served range in size from under 1000 to more than 60,000.1 The Mayo Clinic is located in Rochester, Minnesota, which has a population of 94,950. The data collected and context discussed herein focused on emergency responses in the southeastern Minnesota region Building on prior research collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, the aim of the case study was to explore, from an end-user perspective, challenges and benefits associated with the implementation and use of end-to-end information systems across the interorganizational emergency medical response process see Figure 1 framework developed through prior work \(in Figure 1 Researchers collected data sets used across the process, merged and analyzed the data, and then held a series of focus group discussions with emergency medical practitioners to understand the benefits and challenges of using that data and how information technology could be better utilized to support decision making    1 http://www.mayohealthsystem.org/mhs/live accessed on January 19, 2008 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 4.1. Local Case Study Data Analysis  As discussed above, a first step in this research process was to obtain data that linked patient data across the emergency medical process as a ?proof of concept? to demonstrate to emergency medical practitioners who would participate in the qualitative phase of this study. De-identified data was obtained from the Mayo Clinic for the year 2006 to investigate the range and types of data that exist for automobile crash emergency responses, how well the data integrates across organizational units, and to what extent the data might be useful to practitioners if the data were to be integrated and used for decision making Two data sets were obtained: one for ?prehospital? EMS information and a second one for Hospital Trauma information.  The goal was to link all EMS responses for automobile crash trauma patients that 1 Region, 2 operators and ambulances, and 3 St. Mary?s hospital \(Mayo Clinic Set was sorted to locate only those incidents that were identified as ?motor vehicle accidents \(MVA Once the MVA-related data was obtained connection with the Hospital Trauma Data was then made. To enhance the probability of data matches there were several data fields used to construct a match. These included: date, time, age, sex/gender In sum, the research team successfully linked 179 records of a possible 193 


 Figure 2. EMS Total Travel Time  4.1.1. Data Analysis  After data linkages were made, a general descriptive statistical analysis was conducted on 1 EMS response times, and 2 see Figures 2-4 below In terms of EMS response, or Travel Time starting from 911 call until arrival to a Trauma center, we found that 25% took less than 30 Minutes \(46 75% of them took greater than 30 minutes \(133 is significant to note since automobile crash trauma patients are 5-7 times more likely to survive when arrival to a trauma center is less than 30 minutes [4 However, it is not a surprising statistic given the rural population served by the Mayo Clinic. As described later in this article, participants are keenly interested in decision support capabilities to help support the provision of quality care prior to arrival at a trauma center in part due to the nature of long distance trauma transports  Figure 3. Trauma Length of Stay Days  The length of days that a trauma patient stays at the hospital after being admitted is an important outcome measure for both health care capacity and cost considerations. The trauma data allowed for understanding the frequency of length of stay in days at the hospital. As shown in figure 3 below, the total Length of Stay for these patients ranged from less than one day to 84 days with the mean Length of Stay being 8 days Another important outcome score, from an emergency care provider standpoint, is the Trauma Brain Injury \(TBI adjusted level of injury upon the brain, with an almost completely dichotomous outcome of either major brain trauma \(value=1 value=8 The importance of this exercise was to develop a proof of concept? that data could be integrated across data sets and that meaningful information Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 could be extracted profiling the entire health consumer/patient experience and outcome  Figure 4. Trauma TBI Outcome Scores  As such, the data analysis began to investigate relationships between pre-hospital performance and trauma outcomes. Additional data has been requested from Mayo Clinic to conduct a more in-depth multiyear analysis. The above analysis was presented to emergency care practitioners that participated in the next phase of qualitative research. Interviews and focus group discussions were held to better understand emergency practitioner perspectives on end-to-end? information sharing and integration The following sections present findings from focus group discussions with end users  4.2. Local Case Study Focus Groups  Three focus group sessions were conducted at Saint Mary?s Hospital \(part of the Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. The 14 participants represented organizations across both pre-hospital and hospital domains as shown in Table 1 


and hospital domains as shown in Table 1 Focus group questions focused on challenges and benefits to using inter-organizational information and the requirements for system and process improvement. The data analysis process involved transcription of audio recordings of focus group sessions. After the transcription, the text data was organized along operational, organizational, and governance dimensions as prescribed in Horan and Schooley [17], who developed a framework for analyzing inter-organizational emergency response systems. Findings were then resolved into a set of architecture qualities for an integrated crash trauma information system \(see section 5 below qualitative analysis resulted in eight themes, or characteristics, that the case study participants desired from the next-generation crash trauma information system. A summary of these findings is described below Organization Position Mayo Clinic Emergency Communications Center Manager Program Coordinator Supervisor Mayo Medical Transport air and ground ambulance services Administrator Chief Financial Officer Clinical Nurse Specialist Chair of RescueNet Committee Director of Air Operations, Mayo MedAir Regional Process Coach Mayo Clinic Corporate Communications Director Information Technology Director/Lead Analyst/Programmer Department of Emergency Medicine Physician, Co-Medical Director ? Air Physician, Co-Medical Director Ground Department of Trauma Surgeon, Co-Medical Director ? Air Total Participants:  14 Table 1. Mayo Clinic Focus Group Participants  4.2.1. Operational Level Findings  Unified Patient Records ? While integrated medical records and associated software to capture patient information are used by the Mayo Clinic hospitals, the pre-hospital sector \(i.e., first responders, ambulance provider, 911 communications center implication is that the care providers that arrive to an automobile crash incident are not able to utilize preexisting patient information. Nor is that information forwarded on to a receiving emergency department or trauma center. Participants noted how having such information could significantly reduce data collection time on scene and also provide much needed information \(e.g., medications, pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, blood type, emergency contact information, etc increase quality of care provision across the emergency response continuum of care. Participants noted that an integrated system should allow for identification and ?pulling? and ?pushing? of patient information from and to each authorized care provider 


provider Pre-hospital to hospital performance information analysis gap ? The ability to easily share data between both pre-hospital and hospital domains inhibits a complete end-to-end patient perspective on performance. Often, different elements of crash EMS, and trauma information for the same crash incident exist in different databases in different organizations. Participants discussed how the ability to integrate data across these ?silos? would enable clinical and operational analysis and decision making at select points of care across the end to end process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 and for post incident research and analysis. For example, participants noted the difficulty of assessing the relationship between ambulance response times \(a pre-hospital measure hospital measures be very time consuming and error prone. Participants noted that the ?next generation? system should facilitate performance reporting across emergency response and hospital organizations Clinical Usability ? Participants discussed needed improvements to software systems that they are required to use on a daily basis. Improvements included enhanced interfaces that enable automated data capture as opposed to manual data entry and that fit? with their emergency care processes as opposed to ?getting in the way? of their time-critical work However, many challenges are associated with adopting new technology and integrating it with existing data systems. Participants noted that open standardized, and interoperable software systems are key to allowing for continuous enhancements for more user friendly features Data Communications and Standards Participants are acutely aware of the national movement towards data interoperability and standards development. Several participants noted their involvement in many national conferences and policy groups working to reconcile data communications and standards issues.  A number of participants discussed the essential need to adopt standards to allow for enhanced levels of information integration across organizational boundaries  4.2.2. Organizational Level Findings  End-to-end Awareness ?Participants discussed performance and quality improvement activities within each organizational unit \(hospital, ambulance 911 communications, etc stronger business case for cross-organizational \(endto-end advisory board exists that includes members across organizational units, participants noted that the entire multi-organizational system could benefit by devoting more attention on end user level discussion with consumers from one organization conversing with another. Participants felt that conversing in such a manner would act as a training experience on the importance of ?end-to-end? information integration and performance, thus forwarding the system wide thinking and culture to allow for integrated information systems Stakeholder Involvement ? Mayo Clinic personnel discussed the benefits of working with legislative groups at all levels of government in order to find innovative ways to progress trauma care in their region. Participants agreed that taking upon themselves the role of ?facilitator? to involve a wide 


themselves the role of ?facilitator? to involve a wide range of stakeholders had been important for Mayo?s cultural focus on continuous improvement. In particular, taking a ?bottom up? approach to allowing interested practitioners to get involved had helped to gain additional stakeholder involvement  4.2.3. Governance Level Findings  Use of Contracts ? Within the Rochester, MN area, the Mayo Clinic controls almost the entire endto-end provision of service, from 911 medical phone calls, to air or ground ambulance response, to trauma care.  Outside of the Rochester area there is mixed control including first responders as well as subcontracted and volunteer ambulance providers.  As such, the larger, regional emergency medical services EMS throughout the United States, constructed of many different, loosely coupled, and sometimes competing organizations. When outside the boundaries of control, the Mayo Clinic is faced with the financial and technical aspects related to inter-organizational information sharing and the need for contracts to enforce service performance levels. End user participants discussed the importance of these contracts for ensuring information exchange across provider organizations Non-contract information sharing ? Networks of cooperating and collaborating organizations outside of the Mayo system have been established for the purpose of infusing the Mayo Clinic?s philosophy of high quality patient care. Information sharing and service cooperation often takes place without formal binding contracts in place. This is often at the expense of the Mayo Clinic. But the organizational philosophy is that care provision at the Clinic will be enhanced if inter-connected care providers work like they do ? with a focus on quality patient care  4.3. State Level Stakeholder Focus Group and Evaluation  While the local level case study provided valuable insight, researchers also sought to understand practitioner perspectives from the State level including how crash, EMS, and trauma information is currently being integrated and utilized in the State of Minnesota and challenges and benefits to further integration. Moreover, the discussion focused on how to conceptualize the ?next-generation? system that would not only facilitate the analysis of large archival data sets, but also allow for more real-time analysis Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 from a clinical standpoint. A series of 2 focus group discussions and 3 follow-on interviews were conducted with 16 state level Agency decision makers. Participants represented the following organizations: Emergency Medical Services Regulatory Board \(EMSRB State Trauma System and State Trauma Advisory Council Intelligent Transportation Systems Program and Office of Traffic Safety Traffic Safety  4.3.1 Summary of State Level Focus Group and Interview Findings  Participants discussed that in order for a complete end-to-end view of patient and incident information 


end-to-end view of patient and incident information to provide value to a wide range of consumers, there would need to be data assimilated from a wide range of existing organizations and information systems These data sources would include: telematics providers \(data from automatic crash notification systems ambulance providers, emergency departments trauma centers, public health \(e.g., rehabilitation databases e.g., crash analysis reporting systems e.g., traffic management systems illustrated in Figure 6 Participants discussed operational challenges to achieving this vision, including several data collection issues. For example, there is a lack of state level information collection policies. Paramedics also experience difficulty inputting data due to their need to focus on patient care in time-critical situations The lack of wireless infrastructure can often poses system connectivity problems as well. As such, and to the dissatisfaction of physicians, the electronic incident report from the paramedic is typically received well after a patient has arrived to the ED While many obstacles were discussed, participants agreed that there exists substantial motivation to progress towards a more open, standardized integrated, yet secure and private, information sharing environment. Potential benefits discussed included reducing emergency response times improving decision making capacities, improving patient care, reducing crashes, improving emergency response management capabilities, and reducing disability consequences, fatalities, and associated costs across the State For the purpose of research, participants agreed to share data for the advancement of a ?proof of concept? project. Furthermore, participants supported a research oriented and multi-phased approach understanding the magnitude of such an undertaking and long-term vision of integrated data sharing across the State.  Participants noted the research approach should include stakeholders from across the full spectrum of crash and emergency response organizations, integrate with existing state policy programs, such as the ?Toward Zero Deaths program \(a statewide cooperative to reduce annual traffic fatalities to zero of physicians to provide a ?clinical? perspective on data sharing, and take a multi-phased approach to development beginning with architecture development, prototype creation and testing, and demonstration of a ?proof of concept? as an example of the eventual larger imlementation In sum, focus group participants validated case study findings in terms of issues, challenges and potential solutions for constructing a patient focused end-to-end trauma information system  5. The Need for an Integrated Crash Trauma Information Network \(ICTN  Taking the literature review and Minnesota case study work together, findings indicated the need for a more integrated, clinician focused enterprise model for information system design and data sharing Figures 5 and 6 illustrate an overview of the Integrated Crash Trauma Information Network ICTIN account key features that would be included in the system design. This concept is discussed below 1. At the top level of Figure 5, there are a number 


of end-to-end operational process considerations to provide emergency medical care as seen through the eyes and experience of a patient. The top level of this diagram represents a linear work flow of a patient from emergency notification \(e.g., ACN, 911 phone call provision, and arrival and definitive care provision at an emergency department and/or trauma center Based on findings, emergency responder processes may be viewed as dynamic or sequential. But the sequential representation is meant to take into account the patient experience, an important system design characteristic as described by Schooley and Horan [18 2. As shown in the second level \(from the top Figure 5, a multi-organizational view of the system architecture is an essential consideration for the ICTIN concept. As described throughout this paper and illustrated in Figure 6, many organizations are involved in emergency response activities, from emergency notification through care provision. Many other practitioners and organizations are involved in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 crash analysis, public health research, patient outcome research, and other analyses. Therefore, the architecture needs to accommodate the information and data needs of a wide variety of organizations including authorized access to information, while maintaining the privacy and security of patient information. Fortunately, the technology exists to enable these software quality attributes.  How to implement such attributes in a complex large-scale environment is a challenge yet to be resolved 3. Dynamic information sharing considerations are represented on the third and fourth levels of Figure 5 From this analysis, and prior research, a number of information types, or taxonomies, are captured analyzed, and distributed across EMS organizational actors and hardware and software systems. The view represented here is one that would allow for information to be fully utilized by authorized emergency responders \(and information systems downstream? points of an emergency response episode. For example, rather than waiting for a paramedic to click the ?submit report? button of an electronic patient care record, patient information would be dynamically \(and incrementally physicians at a receiving ED or trauma center. To enable such open systems, web services and related information architecture standards would need to be implemented across organizations and information systems so that both ?push? and ?pull? functionality could exist for any and all authorized users 4. End-to-end performance reporting capabilities across organizations and information systems are also enabled through such an architecture. The ability to pull any number of data elements not  Figure 5. Information Coordination across the Emergency Response Process  only benefits real-time clinical decision making, but would also allow for the creation of customized reports for real-time monitoring \(e.g., dashboards retrospective research and analysis. The idea here is that performance analysis becomes a system design consideration at the outset, as opposed to taking the traditional approach of constructing performance reports after the system has been built. As shown in Figure 6, reporting and analytics would be a key component of the ICTIN 5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics 


5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics are illustrated in Figure 6. Though alluded to in the above discussion, these include a. Security/Privacy: A standard suite of network software, and data security measures would be implemented to ensure safe transport of patient information in accordance with State and National privacy guidelines and laws Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 b. Patient tracking system: In order to accurately identify data from one system to another, there must be a common data identifier that could associate data with a patient, including vehicle, incident, medical information, care provision, receiving hospital medications administered, dispatched emergency resources, time of phone call, etc. The data would all be linked back to the patient for real-time and retrospective analysis. A patient tracking system would facilitate this core function of the ICTIN c. Directory and Access Services: This would be one or several secure databases that include a listing of all authorized organizations and individuals allowed to access ICTIN information. Individuals would register,,be approved by the managing organization, and then allowed access to certain information based on the information access policies prescribed by the managing body. The directory is controlled by a managing entity to be determined by the network stakeholders  5.1. Directions for Subsequent Phases  While there exists a need for an integrated crash trauma information network \(CTIN a paucity of guidance, literature, and directions on how to achieve such a complex system implementation.  As confirmed by the local and state focus group discussions in Minnesota, further exploration into the potential and feasibility of developing an integrated crash trauma information network would provide an innovative advancement from both a research and practice perspective. More specific recommendations for taking a phased and incremental research approach to move the concept forward are discussed below In our phased approach, several methods are being employed.  A first task would be to validate the Minnesota case studies by conducting a comparative case study review in another state. Findings from a cross-case comparison would be used to outline the parameters for an initial prototype of the integrated crash information system. The prototype would be a simplified ?sample? system to provide a ?proof of concept? and illustrate how crash information could be shared from the moment of impact, through emergency dispatch and response, and then into the emergency room and health treatment services. A key component of this prototype will be the integration of data around the patient. Our straw man system CrashHelp series of interviews and focus groups with significant stakeholders in the process, including departments of transportation, public safety, 911, emergency services, and healthcare. Small data sets from crash EMS, health information systems would be collected and used to develop and populate the prototype to demonstrate its utility for safety decision support and planning purposes.  Feedback analysis from policymakers, planners, public health, EMS, safety engineers, emergency planners and citizens will focus on operational, organizational, and policy 


on operational, organizational, and policy deployment challenges surrounding an enhanced EMS system, including possible benefits from its utilization  Figure 6. Organizations and Integrated Crash Trauma Information Network Services  6. Expected Benefits &amp; Conclusion  The Trauma network would organize the information around the patient, providing a user/consumer centric approach to information design and use. In doing so, the trauma network would extend current EMS systems to include a greater range of information, including information that has been requested by emergency room physicians but often not available. This information is expected to improve not only the timeliness, but also the quality of the emergency response and improve patient care An end-to-end trauma network would allow for more holistic data analysis that can be both visualized and conducted in real-time. Just as private sector operations have achieved benefits through integrated customer systems \(e.g., CRM apply to the victim of a trauma. In this case, the issue is not just better customer service but fundamental issues of life and death  8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
