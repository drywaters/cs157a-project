 1  I NTRODUCTION  With the increasing marketing competition and jet oil costs more aircraft operators have become increasingly concerned about reducing their operational and maintenance costs. To meet customers demand, aircraft integrators and systems suppliers are always searching for new technologies and procedures to incorporate into their products In recent years, Prognostics and Health Monitoring \(PHM has been focus of research w ith the challenge of monitoring the life of equipments and systems.

5/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE  2 IEEEAC paper #1747 Version 8, Updated 2008:12:20 industry, reducing the number of delays and increasing safety. The knowledge of the current health state of components and systems in the aircraft and the prediction of their future condition can improve the planning of maintenance activities and the overall spare parts logistics    This task is currently and gradually being accomplished, as more field data become available, correlated with the failure reports and the maintenance records. PHM is about making aircraft more competitive by making them more reliable and it will probably represent an important competitive advantage in the near future [3 In order to determine the health of a system, two types of 
information are mandatory: the indication of the current state of equipment and a hea lth reference indicator. The indication of the current state of equipment is found through the parameters associated with failure modes related to the degradation of the equipment. The health reference indicator can be obtained from a model that represents the equipment\222s physical limits or its known tolerance threshold. Often, such health reference value does not exist or it is not available to estimate the equipment\222s remaining useful life \(RUL\l eads to arbitrary definitions of degradati   For the cases that the health reference indicator is not well established and in the absent of a model, a data-driven approach could be employed. One source of information is 
the raw data collected from th e sensors of the equipment Generally speaking, a large amount of data is required to represent the health status of the system. This article makes use of Support Vector Machines \(SVM\o deal with this large amount of data.  A One Class Support Vector Classifier estimates the region of nominal operation mode and detects the abnormal behaviors that can characterize incipient failures [1 is classifier is also ab le to  distinguish outliers from The SVM technique is used on many areas, including one class, binary and multi-cla ss classification and support vector regression. This approach is applied to linear 


 2 problems but also to non-linear cases using kernel function    This article presents a data-driven methodology using Support Vector Machines classification to build the reference health value and produce a degradation model to be used for health monitoring on on-board aircraft systems This approach intends to define points of operation that can serve as a signature for health monitoring through parameters associated with the degradation of the equipment. Then, using data classification algorithms, the objective is to create a model to determine how close to the nominal behavior the system is operating. It is expected that the cumulative effects of degr adation reduce the remaining useful life of the equipment and change the equipment health state This study focuses on the Health Assessment and State Detection layers of Open System Architecture for Condition Based Monitoring \(OSA-CBM  This methodology was tested using an Auxiliary Power Unit APU\ance parameters database This paper is organized in five sections. Section 2 contains a brief description of the system under analysis. Section 3 presents the adopted methodology. Section 4 presents the implementation steps and section 5 presents the results of the proposed method applied on the APU performance data The last section presents the conclusions of the study and some remarks 2  A UXILIARY P OWER U NIT D ESCRIPTION  An Auxiliary Power Unit \(APU\enerally defined as a device whose purpose is to provide energy for functions other than the vehicle propulsion. On airplanes, the APU fig. 1\ is an independent auxiliary unit capable of generating electric and pneumatic energy. Typically, the APU is located at the tail end of the aircraft The primary purpose of an aircraft APU is to provide power to start the main engines. APUs can also have other auxiliary functions where they provide electrical and pneumatic power without the need and expense of running the aircraft main engines, for in stance: 1\to run the heating cooling, and ventilation systems while the passengers are boarding the aircraft, 2\to power up systems for pre-flight checks, and 3\to allow main tenance and flight crews to operate the flight controls and power equipment. The APU is also used as a backup in flight in case of a main engine or hydraulic pump failures  Figure 1 226 Auxiliary Power Unit \(APU\r an aircraft  Figure 2 226 Typical APU operational profile The typical APU operation can be described as follows: on ground with the engines turned off and the aircraft not using ground equipment, the APU is turned on by a pilot command and from then on its sensors parameters, such as temperature and speed, can be co llected. The next step is the APU start by powering on the starter motor which speeds up the APU until it reaches the self-sustain speed. After that, the starter disconnects and the APU starts to supply compressed air \(through the bleed valve\and electric power to the aircraft. When the aircraft completes its takeoff, the APU is turned off switching its power source to the main engines. This operational profile is reflected on the Exhaust Gas Temperature \(EGT\is typical profile is illustrated on Figure 2 Figure 2 shows the APU temperature normalized by the maximum temperature tolerated by the APU, which is usually supplied by the equipment manufacturer. The EGT indication is zero until the APU is turned on. When the starter motor is turned on, it is possible to see an increase in the EGT until a local maximum is reached and it is turned off. After the APU reaches its steady-state speed, the EGT decreases and stabilizes at the point where the APU runs without any electrical loads and bleed 


 3 Then, when the bleed system and the electrical power are turned on, the APU load incr eases and therefore its EGT also increases. The EGT then peaks and stabilizes at a new temperature level 3  H EALTH M ONITORING M ETHODOLOGIES  Degradation Features Degradation features are need ed if one wants to obtain a health indicator of the system for a particular profile of operation. A set of features extracted from a profile of operating equipment can be represented in the form of a signature, called feature vector  The APU start phase has a typical operational profile reflected in the parameter EGT, illustrated on Figure 2. It is possible to use this profile to extract important characteristics that can be used to estimate the health of the APU Gas turbine manufacturers know that the EGT profile has significant information about the APU perform   18 The EGT i s a cri t i cal parameter for evaluating the condition of the APU. Temperature has a highly nonlinear effect on deformation of the turbine components reducing its useful life. As example, an increase of 50\260 C at the entrance of th e turbine can redu ce the life of its components up to an order of magnit  Considering the profile of the APU start phase, a good feature would be the average value of the APU EGT after reaching the steady-state, whic h represents the EGT without electrical loads or bleed. This value should be similar in each APU start and the average value of EGT in this phase should increase with the APU degradation The steady-state EGT with elect rical loads and bleed is an interesting feature but it is not used in this study. This feature is different in each f light since the demand of the bleed and electric load changes in each flight The other features present in this equipment are: EGT first and second peaks and speed of the APU at the first EGT peak With these features, it is possible to map a profile of the operation of the APU to represent a feature array of normal non-degraded\or of the system. For this case study two parameters were chosen: 1\he EGT without electrical loads or bleed, 2 Usually, the manufacturer supplies a model of steady state of the APU. Using this model one is able to generate information about the parameters of the APU in certain conditions such as static flow of Bleed, external temperature, fuel flow, the operation time and so on Consequently, it is possible to observe the behavior of various parameters of the APU system as a function of time It is expected that the EGT is greater when the equipment is close to the end of its useful life The next step is the classifica tion of features in order to create the health model Degradation Envelope The features extracted are us eful to create a profile of normal behavior and a health measure. The characteristics that fall within the normal envelope will be considered healthy, while the points that are outside of this region are classified as novelties or outliers  One way to generate a health measure of the system is to use the distance between the poi nts that are classified as novelties/outliers and the points that are in the region classified as normal behavior. As the system accumulates stress, this distance should increases. If this is not the case it is likely that the selected degradation features do not contain enough information Another way to generate a health measure of the system is to monitor the number of novelties over time. This criterion aims to reduce the effect of disturbances in normal samples and in outliers. Over time, with the increase in the number of novelties, the algorithm has more novelties than normal data, which would indicate a change in the normal operation of equipment, such as a moving window of the profile over time. In practice, after reaching a percentage of novelties depending on the sensitivity required for the algorithm\, a new training should be performed. This new training represents a new operation profile of the equipment Monitoring this over the life of the equipment, each model should represent a photograph of a certain period in the life of the equipment This work used the method of monitoring the novelties since disturbances in this case study undermine the performance of the method of distance Support Vector Classification The Support Vector Machines \(SVM\were developed by  classifica tion problem, but recently they have been extended to the domain of regression problems SVM classifiers aim to minimize the structural risk, instead of the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization principle used by other classifiers such as neural networks. This provides greater generalization capability to the SVM which is the goal in statistical learning [6 The classification problem can be restricted to consideration of the two-class problem without loss of generality. In this problem the goal is to separate the two classes by a function which is induced from a set of available examples \(called the training set\. This is done by finding the hyperplane that separates the two classes such as the margin distance \(the

A Gaussian function was chosen as the kernel function for the classifier In this case, the parameter to be adjusted is the width of the Radial Basis Function RBF kernel, represented by  A percentage of samples from the feature vectors should be chosen for the training phase. The rest of the data is used for verification to evaluate the results of the proposed classifier 4  I MPLEMENTATION  The health monitoring algorithm was implemented as    Training Phase The training algorithm used for the classifier is given below 225 Load the input matrix of the training dataset to train the SVM classifier.

 5 novelties, otherwise they are cl assified as belonging to the normal region The health monitoring is performed by following the rate of novelties by a sample window over time 5  R ESULTS  This section present the classification algorithm applied on an APU dataset. The degradation features were extracted and used as input to the classifier so that the novelty detector could identify the APU degradation The algorithm has two main parameters 225 The fraction of support vectors which adjusts how much data in the training se t will be considered support vectors 225 The SMV kernel width that adjusts the generalization degree of the classifier It is necessary to choose the number of feature vectors N for the training step, to provide a good starting point to the classifier. The first 120 feature vectors were selected as the training set. The parameter was set to 0.5 to keep half of the initial samples inside the classifier margin \(also called the degradation envelope\ that the classifier initially shows the same sensibility to both types of classification errors \(false detection and misdetection of the novelties The kernel width parameter  was set to 0.2 The training and verification outputs are shown on the Figures 3-5  Figure 3 226 Parameter selection on the training phase  Figure 4 226 Classifier training phase  Figure 5 226 Classifier verification phase  Figure 6 226 Proportion of novelties over the time Figure 6 shows the increase in the proportion of novelties over the time during the verification phase, which indicates the APU degradation as the number of novelties increases from 50% to about 80% in a moving-window of 120 samples. The entire dataset contains about 500 APU flight hours, which is about 8% of the expected APU lifetime 


 6 6  C ONCLUSION AND R EMARKS  This paper has shown a data-driven methodology that can be used in the health monitoring of aeronautic systems. As a data-driven methodology, one of its main advantages is its ability to represent the health of systems whose degradation behavior is not known The results show that the approach of considering classification errors to create a degradation envelope is able to generate a data-driven m odel representing a given point in the life of a system. One of the main points of attention in the development of this method is the sensitivity to outliers in the training set, so it is necessary to filter the data before using it to train the classifier. On the other hand, this methodology can be applied to any system which has abundant data and a degradation that grows slowly in time To further improve the methodology, a comparative study with classifiers others than SVM should be carried out which can yield a better classi fication algorithm or validate the approach used here. Also, in systems not as noisy as the one studied, it may be better to consider the classification distance in itself, not only th e novelties. Finally, different characteristics of degradation may be observed and used to select different failure modes A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work was supported in part by Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos \(FINEP\razil R EFERENCES   F\341bi o M Vi ei ra, Heal t h  M oni t o ri ng of Aeronaut i cal  Systems using Classification Algorithms: APU Case Study in Portuguese\aster Dissertation, ITA, S\343o Jos\351 dos Campos, Brazil, 2008  M Roem er A Hess and B.

Memory Benchmarks We evaluated the memory performance using two benchmarks: a streaming copy benchmark and the random memory access benchmark from Section III The streaming copy benchmark is simple: it allocates a memory buffer, divides it in two, and copies data from one region to the other using PowerPC 450 parallel load/store instructions. The benchmark reports the theoretical peak memory performance if it is run in a noise-free environment The results for several different buffer sizes can be found in Table III. With a 16KB buffer size, which ?ts well in the L1 cache, all kernels perform equally well, because no TLB misses are caused by the benchmark even under standard Linux with 4KB pages. With larger buffers, such as 4MB \(which ?t in the L3 cache which do not ?t Linux kernel is signi?cantly lower than under CNK. Linux with Big Memory shows a 0.2% loss compared to CNK This is a small performance hit, but it is still larger than expected, given that the noise level has been measured at just 0.03% \(see Section III detailed investigation of this phenomenon, but we suspect that instruction cache thrashing at context switch time caused by the OS tick update might be responsible; the benchmark issues a series of parallel load/store instructions, and the cost of cache thrashing might be higher than for an FPU benchmark Table III STREAMING COPY BENCHMARK \(GB/S 16KB 4MB 256MB CNK 6.74 4.60 3.85 Linux 4KB 6.73 3.85 3.35 Linux 64KB 6.74 4.51 3.82 Linux Big Memory 6.74 4.59 3.84 In Section III, we showed the results of the random memory access benchmark on CNK and on Linux with paged memory; there was a large difference in performance Table IV adds the result for Linux with Big Memory support the gap to CNK is narrowed to 0.04%, or within the system noise level Table IV RANDOM MEMORY ACCESS BENCHMARK MB/s CNK 44.70 Linux 4KB 14.39 Linux 64KB 16.40 Linux Big Memory 44.68 B.

LOFAR Online Central Processing We had the opportunity to observe the performance of Big Memory in a real-life application. LOFAR is a radio telescope being built in the Netherlands [15]. In contrast to current radio telescopes that employ custom-built hardware as a correlator, LOFAR uses a Blue Gene/P supercomputer Our previous work discusses the LOFAR central processor in more detail [7], [16 LOFAR stations stream UDP/IP data directly into the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes at a rate of slightly more than 3Gbps These I/O nodes store the data in a main memory ring buffer which is used to absorb network delays or temporary hiccups in the processing pipeline. From here the data is transported to the compute nodes, where the information is correlated Poor main memory performance of the I/O node running the default Linux kernel proved to be one of the major bottlenecks in trying to achieve optimum data throughput Table VII shows a breakdown of the tasks on the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes running the LOFAR online processing application in a fairly standard 16-bit observation mode and a more challenging 4-bit mode. The required CPU resources in processor cores, are shown for the stock IBM I/O node kernel in the 16-bit mode and for a ZeptoOS compute node kernel, modi?ed to run on the I/O nodes, for both the 16bit and 4-bit modes. We see that using the original I/O node kernel would require almost two entire I/O node cores just to handle the ring buffer, and that there are not enough compute resources available to perform all the tasks in real time, even for the less demanding 16-bit mode We used a slightly modi?ed ZeptoOS compute node kernel, including support for the Ethernet device and excluding compute node speci?c devices like the torus network, on the I/O node. We reserved 1536MB of main memory as the Big Memory area and used it for the ring buffer using six 256MB TLB entries. The I/O node application was also adapted to copy 128 UDP/IP packets into the ring buffer at once, instead of one at a time. These two optimizations reduce the resources required to copy data into the ring buffer by more than 600%, about half of which can be attributed to the lack of TLB misses in the Big Memory area The more challenging 4-bit mode signi?cantly increases the potential number of TLB misses. Although limitations in the default kernel make direct comparison impossible smallscale memory benchmarks show a more than 500 reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when 


reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when copying UDP/IP packets one by one Clearly, the access pattern of the LOFAR I/O node application is very susceptible to performance hits caused by TLB misses. With the stock I/O node kernel, the processor was unable to achieve our throughput requirements. Preventing TLB misses for at least part of the application, combined with several other optimizations not discussed here, allowed us to reduce CPU load considerably, increasing I/O node performance to well beyond our original requirements Table VII LOFAR I/O NODE PROCESSING \(#CORES Stock ZeptoOS 16 bit 16 bit 4 bit Receive UDP/IP packets 1.44 1.44 1.22 Copy data to ring buffer 1.80 0.27 0.37 Send ring buffer to CN 1.40 0.52 0.61 Receive data from CN 1.00 0.10 0.35 Send results to storage 0.40 0.32 0.64 Total system load 151% 66.5% 79.7 VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented the implementation of Big Memory support for BG/P Linux  a transparent, ?at memory space for computational processes. Big Memory addresses two major issues encountered when attempting to run highperformance code on the BG/P Linux: poor memory performance caused by TLB misses handled in software, and the dif?culties of writing an ef?cient communication stack caused by the limitations of the BG/P torus  DMA engine Our experiments have shown that benchmarks running under a standard Linux kernel with paged memory can run up to three times slower than under CNK. With Big Memory support, Linux is slower by only 0.03  0.2%. We think that the 0.03% loss is due to the time spent executing the OS tick interrupt handler; with some benchmarks this can grow to 0.2%, presumably because of instruction cache thrashing With further kernel tuning, it should be possible to reduce the noise level to close to zero. Experiments at scale showed a slowdown of well under 1 71 Employing Big Memory on the I/O nodes was instrumental in reducing the I/O node CPU resources required for LOFAR online central processing. A 500  600% performance increase was observed in key parts of the application allowing the I/O nodes to achieve their required throughput Our modi?cations to the Linux kernel are relatively small principally because we focused exclusively on the requirements of computational processes, rather than trying to solve the problem in a generally applicable way, which would have been far more complicated. We maintain two versions of Linux kernel, and we found porting the Big Memory patches between the kernels to be straightforward Contemporary parallel architectures such as Blue Gene/P Cray XT5, and Roadrunner use commodity CPUs such as Intel Xeon, AMD Opteron, or IBM PowerPC, instead of designs dedicated to computational environments. The memory management units in these processors are essentially designed to support a highly multitasking environment. It would be interesting if future designs had hardware support for computational process address space similar to the Big Memory area that we implemented, to allow for a seamless coexistence of high-performance applications and standard Unix processes on the compute nodes Along with the Big Memory implementation, we conceived the idea of a special process that the kernel treats differently from other processes. In the case of Big Memory the kernel creates a different application address space, and we showed that this idea works for compute nodes. We have also experimented with other uses of this feature, such as disabling nonessential interrupts when a computational process gets scheduled in order to reduce the system noise Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking 


Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking and simple applications. We need to make several improvements in the quality of implementation, such as the granularity of the Big Memory area. So far, we have had little experience with running large, real-world applications on the compute nodes using our modi?ed kernel; this area will be explored as part of our future research Acknowledgments: We thank IBM  s Todd Inglett Thomas Musta, Thomas Gooding, George Alma  si, Sameer Kumar, Michael Blocksome, and Robert Wisniewski for their advice on programming the Blue Gene hardware.

interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
