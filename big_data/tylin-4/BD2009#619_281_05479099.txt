GpuWars Design and Implementation of a GPGPU Game Mark Joselli Esteban Clua MediaLab IC-UFF f mjoselli esteban g ic.uff.br Fig 1 Teaser of the GpuWars Game Abstract The GPUs Graphics Processing Units have 
evolved into extremely powerful and 003exible processors allowing its usage for processing different data This advantage can be used in game development to optimize the game loop Most GPGPU works deals only with some steps of the game loop allowing to the CPU to process most of the game logic This work differ from the traditional approach by presenting and implementing practically the entire game loop inside the GPU This is a 
big breakthrough on game development since the CPUs are evolving to multi-core and future games will need similar parallelism as the GPUs programs Index Terms Digital Games Game Architecture GPGPU Game Physics Game AI I I NTRODUCTION The increase of the level of realism in games 
depends not only on the enhancement of modeling and rendering effects but also on the improvement of different aspects such as animation arti\002cial intelligence of the characters and physics simulation Computers new video game consoles such as the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 and GPUs feature multi-core processors For this reason paralleling the game tasks is getting more and more important 
This work has make a game with its tasks execution in parallel with the sequential execution kept to a minimum The development of programmable GPUs has enabled new possibilities for general purpose computation GPGPU which can be used to enhance the level of realism of virtual simulations Some examples of works in GPGPU that address these issues are Quantum Monte Carlos 002nite state 
machines and ray casting 3 A lot of games and works that uses GPGPU to process some parts of its tasks in the GPU and another on the CPU This causes limitation on the simulation because it requires a lot of data transfers between the CPU and GPU and this can be the bottleneck of the simulation This w ork implements all the methods of the game entirely on 
the GPU with the use of CUDA architecture keeping the GPU-CPU communication to a minimum This work is particular important in order to present a paradigm that can be used in currently GPUs and video games Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 but also in future CPU architectures where a massively cores are available The paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents the GPGPU concepts Section 3 presents 
some related works on GPGPU that can be applied to games Section 4 presents the design of the GpuWars game Section 5 presents the architecture and section 6 present the physics aspects of the architecture Section 7 presents the game logic aspects of the architecture and section 8 presents the results

Finally section 9 presents the conclusions and future works II GPGPU GPUs are powerful processors dedicated to graphics computation which are much faster than CPU when considered all the parallel processors available A nVidia 8800 ultra for instance can sustain a measured 384 GFLOPS/s against 35.3 GFLOPS/s for the 2.6 Ghz dual core Intel Xeon 5150 GPUs are very good for processing applications that require high arithmetic rates and data bandwidths Because of the SIMD parallel architecture of the GPU the nVidia GeForce 9800 GX2 for example has 256 uni\002ed stream processors the development of this kind of application requires a different programming paradigm than the traditional CPU sequential programming model Nvidia and AMD/ATI are implementing uni\002ed architectures in their GPUs Each architecture is associated with a speci\002c language Nvidia has developed CUDA Compute Uni\002ed Architecture and AMD developed CAL Compute Abstraction Layer One main adv antage in the use of these languages is that they allow the use of the GPU in a more 003exible way both languages are based on the C language without some of the traditional shader languages limitations such as scatter memory operations i.e indexed write array operations and others that are not even implemented as integer data operands like bit-wise logical operations AND OR XOR NOT and bit-shifts Ne v ertheless the disadvantage of these architectures is that they are only available for the vendors of the software i.e CUDA only works on Nvidia and CAL only works on AMD/ATI cards In order to have GPGPU programs that work on both GPUs it is necessary to implement them in shader languages like GLSL OpenGL Shading Language HLSL High Level Shader Language or CG C for Graphics with all the vertex and pixel shader limitations and idiosyncrasies In the near future it will be possible to use OpenCL Open Computing Language whi ch is available in beta for both nVidia and AMD graphics cards at the moment of the writing of this paper In addition Intel has recently presented a new architecture for GPUs called Larrabee  It is made up of several x86 processors in parallel which can be used to process both graphics and nongraphics data The advantage of this architecture is that it does not need a special language just plain C Nevertheless it will only be available in 2010 III R ELATED W ORK There are a lot of works that deals with the GPGPU 002eld but the application of these works on game 002elds are mostly concentrated on the game physics Physics on the GPGPU is a potential 002eld and many works could achieve considerable speedup by taking the physics calculations from the CPU and processing on the GPU All the major physics engine for games in the market has make or is making attempts to use of the GPU to process its calculations The work of Green presents an implementation on the GPU of some methods of the commercial physics engine called Havok FX which was being constructed to be a GPGPU version of Havok Physis  The Ha v ok FX w as discontinued when Havok was bought by Intel but there are rumors that it will be continued with the release of Intel new architecture for GPU Also the PhysX of nVidia is a ph ysics engine that uses the CUDA architecture to optimizate its calculation Also Bullet 18 an open source physics engine is also investing in porting it to the GPU and has release some demos with some aspects of the engine running on the GPU Also in a h ybrid ph ysics engine that has some of its calculations on the GPU is present Besides the physics engines there are other works related to the implementation of physics simulation processes on the GPU like particle system deformable bodies system and collision detection 22 Physics simulation works very well on the GPU because of the high performance of the stream processors which allows high parallelism of the physics problems that can be solved in this structure With that is possible to have faster physics simulation on games and also more physics realistic games Another 002eld that could be implemented in the GPGPU and can be used by game is the game AI or game logic This 002eld is not very explored and there are very simple works on the 002eld There

are implementation of 002nite state machine on the GPU b ut this w ork implements v ery primiti v e behavior that cannot be used for games Another 002eld that can be used for game that explores GPGPU is crowd simulation like the works  24 25 26 Cro wd simulation can be used in games for simulating the behavior of herbs of animals 25 people w alking on the street  soldiers 002ghting in a battle 28 spectators watching a performance and also to populate game worlds lik e a GT A g a me 30 These works are particularly important since they propose a simple AI model implementation into a GPU architecture There are also some works that deals with the distribution of task between the CPU and GPU like  32 33 19 34 These w orks concentrate on the GPU most the physics tasks of the game and these tasks can be distributed to the CPU Even though these works presents some aspects of the game tasks inside the GPU the present work differs from the latter since it presents all the game tasks that needs to be processed developed inside the GPU There are no available work on the literature that use the GPU to process the entire game logic like the one present in this work just some tasks of the game IV T HE D ESIGN OF THE G AME The GpuWars is a massive 2D prototype shooter with a top-down 2D perspective The game is similar to a 2D shooters like Geometric Wars and E4 The main enhancements of GPUW ars is that it uses GPU to process its calculations allowing to process and render thousands of enemies while similar games only process hundreds The game play is very simple the player plays as a GPU card which is called GPUship inside the computer universe and he needs to process by shooting them polygons shaders and data the enemies from a game Every time the GPUship make physical contact with a enemy it looses time and in consequence it looses FPS The objective is to process the maximum number of data in the smaller amount of time and keep the game interactive with a minimum 12 frames per second The GpuWars uses the keyboard as the input device of the game one set of controls are used to control the movement of the GPUship and another set to control the direction of the shots V T HE A RCHITECTURE Computer games are multimedia applications that employ knowledge of many different 002elds such as Computer Graphics Arti\002cial Intelligence Physics Network and others More computer g ames are also interactive applications that exhibit three general classes of tasks data acquisition data processing and data presentation Data acquisition in games is related to gathering data from input devices as keyboards mice and joysticks Data processing tasks consist on applying game rules responding to user commands simulating Physics and Arti\002cial Intelligence behaviors Data presentation tasks relate to providing feedback to the player about the current game state usually through images and audio In this architecture practically all game logic is processed in the GPU i.e all the data processing tasks only using the CPU for tasks that need to make use of CPU like data acquisition This architecture was implemented using CUDA technology for GPGPU processing OpenGL for rendering GLSL OpenGL Shading Language for shaders and GLUT OpenGL Utility Toolkit for window creation and input gathering The game loop of the GpuWars work as follows First the CPU gather the input and sends it to the GPU The GPU treat this data making the necessary adjustments,i.e the transformation of the player's position and the creation of the players shots The GPU starts updating the bodies by applying the physics behavior on them and their logic behavior which corresponds to the arti\002cial intelligence step These updates are put on a VBO Vertex Buffer Object and sended to the shaders for rendering The GPU also sends variables to the CPU in order to tell if it should terminate the application This game loop is illustrated in 002gure 2 To resume the CPU is responsible for 017 creating a window 017 gather the players input and send it to the GPU 017 make the GPU calls 017 execute the music and sound effects

Fig 2 Game Loop of GpuWars 017 and terminate the application i.e destroy the windows and release the data While the GPU is responsible for 017 applying the physics on the bodies 017 process the arti\002cial intelligence 017 determinate the game status like the player scores 017 and determinate the end of the game The data that is exchanged between the CPU and GPU is encapsulate in special structure in order to keep the communication between the CPU and the GPU to a minimum since this process can be a bottleneck of any simulation that has communication between CPU and GPU GPGPU programs are divided in threads In order to process the main game logic which needs to be executed sequentially the proposed architecture have a special CUDA thread is responsible for it which is the same that treats the GpuShip data and inputs This processing includes update the position of the GpuShip accordingly to the input creation of shots which are created in other CUDA threads determinate the scores determinate the game over and determinate the creation of new enemies The others threads are responsible for updating the enemies and the shots like collision detection and response and the individuals behavior The positions and type are put in a VBO and sent to a vertex shader in order to render the individuals without using the CPU Also to deal with the creation of the shots and enemies the architecture keeps a list with the values to indicate available positions for individuals creation Using this structure the GPU processes some empty threads threads that practically does not process anything and also different codes in different threads but since similar threads are put together in a CUDA block this have little effect on the performance Figure 3 illustrate the process of the different threads GPGPU programs does not have native pseudo random number generation In order to ful\002ll that need this work developed a pseudo-random number generation based on nVidia demo In order to implement this architecture some data structure are needed this are the data that are required for each individual 017 one vector with the individual position 017 one vector with the individual force 017 one vector with the individual direction/orientation 017 one integer as the individual type which can be player shot or enemy types 017 one integer with the individual energy 017 one 003oat for the individual mass This architecture is build in a way that it can be also used with proper modi\002cations in 3D games In the next sections the most important steps there are processed on the GPU the physics step and the AI step are present VI P HYSICS S TEP This step is responsible for the physics behavior i.e how the bodies process and resolve all bodies collisions and response The physics of this architecture work is based on the physics on particle systems  40 20 and in a h ybrid ph ysics engine 19 Collision detection is a complex operation For n bodies in a system their must be a collision detection check between the O  n 2  pairs of bodies Normally to reduce this computation cost this task is performed in two steps 002rst the broad phase and second the narrow phase In the broad phase the collision library detects which bodies have a chance of colliding among themselves In the narrow phase

Fig 3 The Different Process of the CUDA Threads of GpuWars a more re\002ned algorithm to do the collisions tests are performed between the pairs of bodies that passed by the broad phase The physics step is responsible for 017 Make the broad phase of the collision detection 017 Calculate the narrow phase of the collision detection i.e apply the collision in each body 017 Forwarding the simulation step for each body by computing the new position and velocities according to the forces and the time step i.e integrating the equations of motion A The broad phase This phase is responsible for avoiding the n 2 comparison between all the individuals and also avoid doing a narrow phase of the collision detection between the n 2 individuals There are many ways to do this spatial hashing This work uses a uniform grid which has a constant building cost which makes the simulation more constant and is very suitable for the parallel structure of the GPU Also this structure is used in the AI step in order to determinate the vision of the bodies This work has based its implementation on the

spatial hashing with sort of the nVidia particles demo and the CUD A broad phase implementation This w ork dif f ers from such implementation because it is adapted and optimize the structure and methods to be used with the GPGPU game loop process and to 002ll the requirements of the GpuWars game which needs bigger grids and larger number of objects in the grid in order to be faster for the AI steps which uses the grid to simulate the vision of the enemies B The narrow phase of the collision detection The narrow phase of the collision detection is responsible for doing the collision detection among the rigid bodies In this work instead of doing the collision check between all the polygons of the individuals it is implemented a basic primitive area element that complex models are put inside There are two types of bounds that this work implements used to surround every model simplifying the narrow phase of the collision detection a circle bounds and a bounding rectangle The circle bound is used whenever is possible This is done in order to save memory since the circle bound only needs the position vector and a radius while the bounding rectangle needs four variables C The Integrator This method is responsible for integrating the equations of motion of a rigid body In this work it consist on a simple step since it does not takes into account the angular velocities and torque This method updates crowd individual velocity based on the forces that are applied to it which are sent to the integrator and then it updates the position based on its velocities using an integration method based on Euler integration Euler integration is one of the simplest form of integration Mathematically it evaluates the derivative of a function at a certain time and linearly extrapolate based on that derivative to the next time step VII AI S TEP Game AI refers is used to produce the illusion of intelligence in the behavior of non-player characters NPC and in the case of GpuWars the enemies There are a lot of ways to implement the game AI such as 002nite state machines fuzzy logic neural networks and many others This w ork uses 002nite state machine FSM Finite state Machines are powerful tools used in many computer game implementations 45 46 lik e the NPC behavior the characters animation states and the game menu states A 002nite state machine is a model of behavior composed of a states the transitions between those states and the actions This work implements 3 different behaviors using FSM the kamikaze group and tricky behaviors which are present in the next subsections The behaviors are affected by the size of vision which uses the grid made by the broad phase of the collision detection velocity and energy which are variables available for each type of enemy With the modi\002cation of these values this work implements seven different types of enemies A Kamikaze Behavior The kamikaze approach is a behavior that simulates suicidal attacks It uses a state machine that has only four state wandering attacking checking energy and dead and can be seen on 002gure 4 Fig 4 The Kamikaze State Machine The kamikaze is a very simple behavior It wanders until it sees the GPUShip then it goes attacking it by throwing itself against it This approach is well suited for a GPU architecture since few information about the scene is necessary

B Group Behavior The group behavior is a behavior that make groups avoid bullets and attacks It has a state machine that has six state wandering grouping attacking checking energy avoiding bullets and dead and can be seen on 002gure 5 Fig 5 The Group State Machine This behavior is also very simple The individual wanders trying to 002nd similar individuals i.e individuals of the same type and the GPUShip If it sees a similar individual it goes close to it and make a group And if it can see the player it attacks the player by throwing itself against it If the individual sees a bullet coming in its direction it tries to avoid it C Tricky Behavior The tricky behavior is the most complex behavior of the game This behavior tries also groups similar individuals and it is the only that recoveries energy It has a state machine that has seven states wandering grouping attacking avoiding bullets checking energy escaping and dead and can be seen on Figure 6 The enemy wanders trying to 002nd the GPUShip or similar individuals If it sees a similar individual it goes close to it and make a group If it is seeing the player it throws itself against it If the individual Fig 6 The Tricky State Machine sees a bullet coming in its direction it tries to avoid it If it has little energy it tries to scape to recover the lost energy VIII R ESULTS This work has decided to make the tests in the minimum hardware that can run CUDA a notebook with an AMD Turion Dual-core with 3GB RAM memory and equipped with nVidia Geforce mobile 8200M GPU card which has only 8 stream processors running on Windows Vista The number of enemies determines the performance of the game This work has decided to have a maximum bound of 8192 enemies A screenshot of the game can be seen of 002gure 7 To better view the performance 002gure 8 show a graph with the performance in FPS of the game in 1000 frames of the application From this 002gure can be seen that the performance of the game ranges from 45 to 58 frames per second This performance is considered optimal in a game  The game was also tested with a more powerful hardware a quad-core with a nVidia GeForce 8800GS GPU card which has 96 stream processors with similar results but with a speedup of three times the FPS ranges from 130 to 170

The fact that the genotypes have been generated by recombination makes it very hard to close the set of bases by intersection. As mentioned before, haplotype inference studies usually select data from blocks where recombination probability is almost 0, so the instances in our experiments with recombination level 4, 16 and 40 are not even realistic but were tested because they are a kind of standard in the literature The results of the non-uniform instances are shown in table IV. Non-uniform instances are a little harder than uniform instances. Taking into consideration the number haplotypes generated by each preprocessing method we can see that the difference gets bigger as the problem size grows being zero or almost 0 for the smallest instances. It is also worth noticing that the time spent by the tabu search when data is preprocessed with the set-based preprocessing is lower than that of the RTIP preprocessing for 78 of the 90 instances The hapmap instances are considered hard; the execution 


information of all of them is shown in table V. The number of sites of the hapmap instances is denoted by the last two characters of the name of the instance and the number of genotypes varies between 5 and 68. Only one of the 24 instances is aborted because it exceeds the given time limit Experiments show that is the same instance that SHIP and RPoly abort.

For small instances RTIP-based method is usually quicker and the number of haplotypes generated is almost the same as the number of haplotypes generated by the RTIP-based procedure. This is a deterministic process so execution times are quite similar Although the tabu search process was firstly implemented to test the preprocessing procedures it has proved to be an effective algorithm for the HIPP problem. The refinement process in the intensification phase is probably the strongest procedure in the tabu search; this is the procedure that, in most cases, returns the optimal solution Table V shows the result of the total number of instances solved by our algorithm another five solvers, which can be found in the reference section. Our algorithm, which was implemented in Java, was tested with a time limit of 10,000 seconds on a MacBook 2.1 with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor up to 2.16GHz and 3GB RAM, although, JVM  s maximum heap size \(on Mac OS X five solvers were tested by Lin  e and Marques-Silva  [10 with a time limit of 10,000 seconds, using a 1.9GHz Athlon XP. However, using different machines to test the solver does not mean that the number of solved instances can be increased, since, when solved, the executions of our algorithm never took longer than 4 minutes  VI. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a new preprocessing algorithm for the HIPP problem coupled with a tabu search. This new preprocessing is based on manipulating subsets of haplotypes instead of haplotype units. The experimental results show that in the hardest instances this new preprocessing step can dramatically decrease the time spent by the whole algorithm \(preprocessing + tabu search fact is due to the reduction in the search space provoked by the new preprocessing. On the other hand, the new preprocessing does not work properly in instances with recombination. However, we can think about the two proposed preprocessing algorithm as complementary procedures, because the weaknesses of the set-based procedure \(recombination and small instances solved by the RTIP-based procedure As mentioned before, our aim was to develop a new preprocessing method to deal with large problem instances but, since the implemented tabu search has proved to be an effective algorithm, new functionalities should be developed  VII.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
