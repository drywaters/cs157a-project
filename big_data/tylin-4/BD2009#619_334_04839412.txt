 1  Band-Limited 2-D Interpolation using NUFFT  Ronald M. Bloom The Aerospace Corporation El Segundo, CA 90245 Ronald.M.Bloom@aero.org    Abstract 227There exists a class of algorithms for fast approximate evaluation of trigonometric sums arising from extension of discrete Fourier transforms \(DFT and IDFT\o irregular sample locations. These are referred to in the literature as \223Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transforms\224 or 223NUFFT\224 12 These allow Fourier \(trigonometric\nterpolation to be done, for a given set of complex DFT coefficients, to a high degree of uniform approximation, in order 
 2 NO flops.  This facilitates the theoretically pleasing prospect of using a Discrete Fourier Series to interpolate image data from a regularly sampled grid to intermediate irregular sample locations 
Brute-force evaluation at 2 N  spatial locations, of a discrete 2-D Fourier series consisting of 2 N modes scales as 
 4 NO and is prohibitive for image arrays on the order 3 10 
002 N and above.. There are three variants of the trigonometric sums to be evaluated by such algorithms.  The \223Type-2\224 varian t is that in which we sum a set of regular locations in the discrete Fourier domain, to evaluate the inverse transform at an irregular set of locations in the image domain. In other words, it is a method that allows us to use Fourier interpolation, with a relatively large number of DFT modes and a relatively large number of interpolation sites  TABLE  OF  CONTENTS  1

model for the data collection and image generation process is that of a low-pass or band-pass mechanism; and hence the data may be regarded as \223band-limited\224, in the following special sense. Discrete Band-limited data, defined ab-initio by a finite set of regular samples on a closed domain can be regarded as specialization of the ShannonNyquist sampling theorem to the case of a band-limited 223line spectrum\224; i.e. data generated by a finite Fourier Series. In this situation the Shannon-Nyquist \223cardinal Sine\224 series collapses to a finite convolution with a Dirichlet kernel. Equivalently, the natural representation for the continuous function whose discrete samples we possess is that obtained by extending the inverse-discrete Fourier transform to arbitrary spatial locations in between the nodal points. The natural interpolator for such data then consists in the evaluation at numerous intermediate spatial locations of a \(double\screte Fourier Series, whose complex coefficients are provided to us  2  D ISCRETE

  6. Conclusion and Future Work  This paper presented the FADES approach using the SNS case study. This research addressed a case study that represents a sample of the category of communication systems using the FADES approach This category of systems share a common set of security requirements that have been elaborated in the paper. This assists in verifying the applicability of FADES to communication systems that exhibit high security demands. We have also illustrated how the underlying formality allows for documenting design decisions and trace these decisions to their corresponding security requirements While this paper demonstrated the conceptual framework of FADES, a number of future research steps are ongoing. We have embarked on case studies from other categories of software systems for further refinement and to show its applications. Further FADES is being quantitatively compared to other relevant approaches that derive design from requirements. The comparison will involve the application of both FADES and the other comparable approaches to the same case studies to measure the strength and limitations of FADES as opposed to other relevant approaches Future work might involve the demonstration of the capability of FADES to structurally handle other categories of maintenance activities \(perfective adaptive and preventive  Acknowledgement  This work was supported in part by Science Foundation Ireland grant 03/CE2/I303_1 to Lero-the Irish Software Engineering Research Center www.lero.ie Thanks to Dr. Van Lamsweerde who granted us a free license of the Objectiver software that has facilitated our work in the elicitation and modeling of security requirements using the KAOS framework  References  1  A. van Lamsweerde Elaborating Security Requirements by Construction of Intentional AntiModels  Proc.

EIS System Network View Meta-model operations are those used for service description and must be ultimately decomposed into elementary ones \(i.e. data processing, storing and transferring are estimated through parameter values that are propagated by service invocation parameters to parameters describing application operations constituting the service description which are further propagated to parameters describing elementary operations 4.3. EIS Architecture Design Task Implementation EIS Architecture Design tasks may be supported by existing tools [20]. Systems Modeling Language \(SysML 15] is considered as the most appropriate for EIS System Network model representation and requirement engineering, since it supports the concepts of requirements and resource allocation. As a direct consequence, SysML allows the representation of requirements as model elements which means that requirements are part of the system architecture. For representation purposes, a SysML pro?le for EIS System Network meta-model \(?gure 6 mented as a plugin to MagicDraw modeling tool [2]. In order to facilitate model exchangeability, EIS System Network model is being realized in XML, which is a standard exchangeable format. In order to exchange data with speci?c software tools, model transformations will be accomplished through appropriate XSLTs developed for each tool for example as the one transforming XMI to the EIS System Network document type description \(DTD 5. Case Study In the following we discuss the case of renovating a legacy information system supporting a large-scale public organization based on the proposed concepts. The organization supports more than 350 interconnected regional of?ces and its main purpose is to provide services to the public both citizens and businesses. Regional of?ces are divided into three categories according to their size and information infrastructure requirements \(large, medium and small More than 15.000 employees work in the organization having on-line access to the legacy system. There are more than 300 different services provided to the public, while each citizen is required to register in the one belonging to his/her residential area, called residential of?ce. Some of them require the actual presence of citizens in their residential of?ce Existing system architecture is based on a fat clientserver architecture. All application logic is programmed within the client platform, while data is distributed in local database servers located in each regional of?ce. A Central database is supported in the Datacenter for data synchronization and lookup purposes. The Datacenter and all regional of?ces participate in a private TCP/IP network to facilitate ef?cient data replication. Most data related to a speci?c citizen are maintained as local data in his/her residential of?ce. Client programs access the local database to store data, while they access the central database mostly for lookup purposes. Local data are asynchronously replicated in the central database using a transaction management system \(TMS Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 to facilitate communication with the central database. The central database provides the overall view of each citizen  s record 


record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description. This was crucial in order to decide upon Intranet and Datacenter architecture. This information was collected by interviewing software developers The new system has to deal with a number of require&lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Small Regional Office oracle L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt tuxido L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt L.R.O. department tuxido Central

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
