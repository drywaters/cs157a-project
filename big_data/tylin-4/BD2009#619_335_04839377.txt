The purpose of the Mission Set Analysis Tool is to help forecast future demand by \(1 cataloguing the characteristics of potential future DSN-user missions consistent with NASA\222s Space Communications Mission Model, \(2\culating the demands that these missions will place on the DSN and \(3\ission requirements for other DSN architectural analysis tools 
This tool takes the informa tion associated with the Space Communications Mission Model \(SCMM\ to the next level 226 using an Microsoft EXCEL 256 based database to catalog and process some 300 mission parameters.  These parameters fall into one of five broad categories: mission identity and affiliation, operational schedule communication system capabilities, data rates and ground tracking schedules.  Because NASA\222s mission forecast changes frequently, analysis templates are used to select sets of missions from the database for analysis.  Communication link budgets are calculated for particular dates during mission operation based on mission parameters and automated ephemeris algorithms.  The result is expressed in terms of the receiving area on the ground required to close each particular communication li nk.  Plots of this receiving area as a function of time and frequency band reveal future demand for different mission sets.  The most demanding 
individual communication links are automatically identified Radio-frequency \(RF Earth to mission downlinks \(mission to Earth\reated separately The Mission Set Analysis Tool also creates mission requirements used by other analysis tools to assess the cost operability \(link performance\d load capacity of proposed DSN architectures 12 3  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  T OOL D ESIGN 2  2.1.

It is useful to anal yze the communications needs of future missions, and demands they will place on NASA\222s Deep Space Network \(the DSN\indicate trends in overall demand for tracking time on the DSN 
while shifts in microwave band usage are quickly identified Individual missions that drive future capabilities are easily identified for closer examination.  Such information is useful in identifying and analyz ing future architectures for the DSN However, the mission model changes on a weekly basis Further, manual \(EXCEL worksheets\ysis of trends in communications can be labor intensive, making it difficult to keep up with analysis needs.  Our solution was to construct an automated database of NASA mission information, perform automated analyses with the data and couple the database to other analysis  3  Link budget calculations are commonly used to characterize the difficulty of maintaining communications with satellites 


  2 in space.[4]  These calculati ons are usually performed manually, and involve the input of hundreds of parameters and much labor to achieve the expected 0.2 dB of absolute accuracy.  To avoid this obstacl e, it is highly desirable \(even with some sacrifice in accuracy\ate link budgets so that the hundreds of links carried in an automated database can be calculated in minut es, rather than weeks The separation between Earth and the spacecraft is a key parameter in the performance of communications links Any accurate assessment of performance must include realistic, accurate separation data.  We propose a method for deriving separation data that works \(with varying degrees of accuracy\issions that will launch 25 years from now, as well as for well-known missions that are currently flying 2  T OOL D ESIGN  2.1  Implementation Microsoft EXCEL was used to implement the Mission Set Analysis Tool mainly because of its nearly universal portability.  Separately linked workbooks are used to implement distinct functionality.  Most functionality is implemented using Visual Basic for Applications \(VBA Heavy use is made of user-defined object classes Conventional worksheet \(WS\ions were almost never used to implement functionality; instead, they are used primarily for user interfaces In an application of this complexity, WS functions would result in thousands of formulas intertwined between dozens of worksheets making the tool difficult to debug and extend.  VBA is a structured, compiled, object-oriented programming language with good authoring and debugging tools and is automatically maintained within EXCEL workbooks Further, VBA is much faster than WS functions for the same functionality.  User forms are also used extensively for context-dependent user interfaces Data is passed between workbooks using \223Data Sockets\224 implemented in visual basic.  This is usually accomplished by referencing a function in another workbook that passes a user-defined data object or data collection The data structure is implemented through user-defined objects within VBA.  These objects not only contain stored values for parameters, but also implement code that evaluates low-level functions based on object data.  An example of a low-level data function would be the gain of a ground antenna \(a data object\ts diameter This flexible internal structure does not map well to the fixed structure of EXCEL WS tables.  As a result, an Input Sheet with a fixed data structure was developed.  This structure places practical limits on the data that can be entered.  For example, only six operational segments can be defined in a single column, even though the missions can have dozens of operational segments.  Such limits have been overcome using \223extension\224 columns in the input table Sometimes a mission is comprised of several input columns on the input sheet.  For example, the Stereo Ahead and Stereo Behind spacecraft are part of a single NASA mission.  This is accomplished by using a mission identifier for each input column.  Columns  with the same mission identifier are considered a single mission The database is stored internally on a single WS table with flexible \(mission-dependent\ructure.  This internal table  is large and cumbersome, but can be read and edited directly.  This form of the data is used for archive purposes 4  2.2  Architecture The Mission Set Analysis Tool uses on open architecture in which separate functions are contained within separate EXCEL workbooks.  The workbooks in the tool are shown schematically in Figure 1.  The function of these workbooks is as follows Data Engine Data Format Checking Data Echo GUI Internal Table Data Editing GUI Analysis of Completeness Ephemeris Validation Op Seg Date Continuity Data Analysis Engine Tabular Reports Counting Analysis Mission Driver Analysis Link Budget Analysis Outputs to Other Analyses Mission Ephemeris Data Analysis Templates Template Definition Mission Modification Link Budget Analysis Data Archive User Mission Sets Analysis Tool Output Boxes represent Separate EXCEL Workbooks  Figure  1: Mission Set Analysis Tool Architecture  Data Engine is the core of the database.  Its primary function is to accept, store and validate data, and disseminate data to other functions in the tool.  It includes a graphical user interface \(GUI viewing/editing data.  It stores the current working version of the database in the internal table Structured data input and output are provided through EXCEL worksheet with identical formats 2  4 Use of an XML-like ASCII \(American Standard Code for Information Interchange\ format was explored; but it was found that the spreadsheet format was more compact.  The database itself is not large by modern standards \(several hundred missions Performance and file size has never been practical issues on modest PC workstations 


  3  Figure 2: Screen shots of the data editing GUI interface in the Data Engine workbook Data Analysis Engine provides predefined analyses and interfaces to other analysis t ools.  It also manages user sets, analysis templates and link budget analysis Data Archive retains multiple copies of past internal tables copied from the Data Engine.  These may be restored to the Data Engine and used to access previous version of the database Analysis Templates accepts and modifies parameters from the working database \(stored in the internal table in the Data Engine mplate definitions.  The modified database is then passed to the Data Analysis Engine for analysis User Missions Sets holds custom definitions of mission sets used by individual users to quickly select missions for analysis  Link Budget Analysis provides uplink and downlink analysis for a single mission based on database parameters and default values Mission Ephemeris Data contains tables for Earth-tospacecraft separation, ri ght ascension angle and declination angle for major missions and planets.  Data is tabulated at 30 day intervals between 1960 and 2050 2.3  Data Structure The structure and content of the database has evolved significantly over the course of development.  The internal structure of data is shown in Figure 3.  The top-level structure is called a MN.  It contains parameters identifying the mission, programmatic information, categorization and development phase information.  Each MN also has a collection of operational segments \(OP SEGs SPACECRAFT For Each MN Program Cooperating Agencies Mission NASA HQ Lead Directorate Full Name and Aliases U.S. Lead Center Mission Description Requested DSN Services Destination Description Mission Development Phases \(A-E Start/End Freq Category \(Cat A/B Launch Date Trajectory Description Collection of Operation Segments Mission Set Affiliations Collection of Spacecraft Theme Area Lead Agency For Each Op Seg Start Date Trajectory Description End Date Propulsion and Formation Type Duration Uplink Rate 1 and 2 From Location Downlink Rate 1 and 2 To Location Local Link Separation Collection of Ground Tracking Subnets For Each SUBNET Hours per Track Tracks per Interval Hours per Interval For Each SPACECRAFT Multiplicity Description Collection Comm Links For Each COMM LINK Name Trans Power Band Mod Scheme Freq Error Correcting Code Ant Diam or Gain HW Data Rates  Figure 3: Data Structure An OP SEG describes operation of the mission during a specified time period.  The OP SEG contains information on trajectories, locations, data rates \(uplink and downlink local \(not direct to Earth\munications links.  Each OP SEG also contains ground tracking needs for each DSN SUBNET 5 70m, 34m, 26m and arrays Each SPACECRAFT object contains data on multiplicity for multi-spacecraft missions LINK channels.  These channels are described by a frequency band and/or user-d efined frequency, antenna diameter, transmitter power, m odulation scheme and errorcorrecting code.  Frequencies supported by the channel are also given \(discrete or ranges 2.4  Data Collection Compilation of data has been a labor-intensive process beginning with the collection and review of hundreds of documents.  For already-flown missions, sufficient information is usually available from public sources Information for future missions generally comes from public web sites and internal reports.  This work has been accomplished by five part-time reviewers over the last year and will continue in order to keep the database current A schematic of the data collection process is shown in Figure 4.  After editorial review, new or modified data is placed in a structured i nput sheet and stored on a DocuShare\256 site.  Periodically, input sheets are collected verified6, and transferred to the internal table in the Data Engine.  From there, it is stor ed in the archive, and echoed back to the reviewer using the same input sheet format Data is transferred to the Data Analysis Engine where it can be used to automatically generate reports, or reformatted and transferred to other analysis engines  3  5 The DSN groups ground antenna assets into \223Subnets\224 according to antenna diameter.  The antenna \223array\224 subnet is hypothetical at this time 6 223Verified\224 here means that the data is checked for format and valid range

An automated tool for checking completeness and consistency is frequently used.  Automated algorithms identify gaps in OP SEG dates. An automated pl ot of spacecraft-to-Earth separation \(for example, see Figure 7\s used to verify OP SEG locations and ephemeris data.  Results from link budget calculations are a very sensitive indicator of data completeness and accuracy.  These calculations use a wide range of data to determine the antenna resources on the ground required to close communication links with the mission.  Values that greatly exceed DSN capabilities or are too small to be credible are easily flagged for correction  2.6  Archiving The database is routinely archived to prevent data loss.  The internal table representation is copied, line-for-line, into a WS in the Database Archive workbook.  The database administrator maintains a complete set of archived databases; data reviewers only receive the last few versions due to e-mail size limitations 3  A NALYSIS T EMPLATES  The NASA future mission model is dynamic, changing on a weekly basis.  Missions in the out-years come and go mission timing is often changed Analysis templates are used in order to respond quickly to changes and to facilitate 223what-if\224 studies of modified mission sets.  An analysis template specifies a mapping of the database in the internal table into a temporary analysis database, possibly with data changes.  Allowed data changes are Mission Name may be different in the analysis database The same mission from the internal table  may appear multiple times within the analysis database using different names.  For example, the Dawn mission is sometimes used to represent the NASA Discovery Missions 13-17 for analysis purposes 7  Launch Date \226 may be advanced or delayed in time.  Dates for all OP SEGs are changed by the same amount Ephemeris data is unchanged from the original schedule.  For example, this allows the same Dawn mission in the internal table to represent different Discovery missions launching at different times Mission End Date 226 The end date of the last OP SEG is changed to the specified date If the end date occurs in an earlier segment, that OP SEG is truncated, and subsequent OP SEGs are eliminated.  This is usually used to extend or shorten extended science OP SEGs Data Engine Internal Table Data Analysis Engine Te m pl at e Specification Ta bl e Analysis Templates Tem plate Definition Table Baseline Database DB Copy Modify Modified Database DB Analysis  Figure 5: Schematic diagram of analysis template process Missions \(particularly at Mars\en vary data rates during an OP SEG in order to compensate for changing separation while maintaining maximum data return.  However, data rates in the database are represented by a single value during each OP SEG.  Thus, projected ground antenna needs may inadvertently exceed the maximum 70m DSN antenna diameter.  Templates have the option to impose antenna size limits on selected missions. Data rates may also be reduced in proportion, at user option For study purposes, templates also have the ability to impose \223blanket\224 antenna size limits.  So, for example every mission may be automatically limited to only 34m antennas on the ground, with corresponding reductions in data rate.  Automatic changes of spacecraft hardware from X-Band to Ka-Band on unmanned, deep-space missions are also possible Analysis templates have proven to be essential in \223what if\224 studies.  The future NASA mission set will be determined 4  7 The Discovery Missions 13-17 are not scheduled to fly until 2014-2032 The communications needs of these missions are not known, but are modeled in the database as \223Dawn-like.\224 


  5 by many factors, including science objectives and funding Opinions vary on funding in the out years.  Templates allow us to construct high- and low funding versions of the set in order to estimate the range of communication capacity the DSN may have to provide.  Such studies would be very difficult without the use of analysis templates 4  T ABULAR R EPORTS AND U SER S ETS  Users have ability to form WS tables from any combination of database parameters.  This function is useful in reviewing database content, and in constructing custom analyses not provided by automated analysis functionality Figure 6: Parameters for the tabular report are selected using a GUI Using missions listed in the tabular report, users can construct and store arbitrary sets.  These sets can later be used to quickly specify which particular missions are to be used in automated analysis 5  S PACECRAFT E PHEMERIS A LGORITHM  Ephemeris data \(spacecraft-to Earth separation, right ascension and declination\are derived in different ways depending on the nature of the mission.  For missions that are already flying, or will fly within a few years, accurate ephemeris data are usually available 8 Data are downloaded and tabulated for missions and also for major solar system bodies \(planets, Luna, etc.\ intervals in a table format.  This table is then interpolated \(linearly determine the approximate separation, right ascension and declination 9 at any given time 5  8 Accurate ephemeris data is availa ble from the JPL \223Horizons\224 web site http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons 9 Right ascension and declination are not used explicitly by the database e.g., for link calculations.  They ar e used, however, by other analysis packages which \223feed\224 o ff of this database Figure 7 shows an example of the separation data for the Cassini-Huygens mission now orbiting Saturn.  During the cruise phase \(1997-2004\he data show an erratic increase in distance \(red curve\is is due to several gravity-assist fly-bys \(Venus\(2\h and Jupiter\ changes as the Earth orbits the Sun After cruise, the distance continues to show the annual variation due to Earth\222s orbit plus a slow increase due to the motion of Saturn Many missions in the database are decades from launch; so accurate ephemeris data are not available.  In such cases separation is approximated us ing fixed beginning and end waypoints during each OP SEG.  An example of such a treatment for Cassini-Huygens is also shown in Figure 7 223Earth\224 and \223Saturn\224 are a ssumed to be the spacecraft waypoints at the beginning and end of the cruise OP SEG During this period, separation is interpolated linearly between the waypoints.  As can be seen, this is not a very good approximation in the cruise OP SEG.  But for many missions with no real orbit information, the waypoint approach is a reasonable method for estimating separation Beyond the cruise OP SEG the \223Saturn\224 waypoint coincides very closely with the actual Cassini-Huygens separation Multiple OP SEGs with multiple waypoints are used to improve accuracy.  Right ascen sion and declination are not available using the waypoint method In some cases, e.g., spacecraft orbiting the Sun, convenient waypoints \(solar system bodies\ available.  For these cases, artificial waypoint distan ces can be inserted at the beginning and end of each OP SEG.  Separation is then interpolated between the specified distances 6  A UTOMATED L INK B UDGET C ALCULATIONS  The Mission Set Analysis Tool uses an automated but simplified form of the normal JPL/DSN link budget calculati The norm a l cal cul a t i on i s very ri gorous using several hundred input para meters to account for every detail of spacecraft, antenna, atmospheric and data processing losses.  The effi ciency characteristics of individual ground antennas are used; losses for actual spacecraft designs are incor porated.  These detailed calculations are accurate to approximately 0.2 dB Unfortunately, the spacecraf t loss characteristics of spacecraft launching in 2025 are simply not known at this time \(to within 3 dB, a factor of two\Further, DSN capabilities should be represented by average antenna properties, not the detailed characteristics of any single antenna.  For rapid studies it is also important that link budget calculations be totally automated

The schematic diagram depicts four main elements of the calcula tion: the spacecraft, free space the atmosphere, and the ground antenna and data processing.  The main paramete rs for each element are also shown.  For the spacecraft, some parameters come from database information \(DB\ile others are set to default values.  Use of defaults avoids the need for highly detailed individual spacecraft data that are not usually available Atmospheric attenuation is defaulted to the value at Goldstone, CA, USA \(by microwave band\t values for the ground antenna are taken as average values for 34m DSN antennas \(by band where appropriate The automatic link budget algorithm first determines if the calculation can be completed by looking at the available data.  If it cannot, a diagnostic is issued which identifies the missing \(or invalid\a and indicates the reason for terminating the calculation.  Links with complete data are labeled \223working,\224 and output results are provided This approach allows the data base to compute the receiving area needed on the ground for nearly 1000 links, all within about 60 seconds.  Details of the calculations are given in Appendix A: Uplink and Downlink Budget Calculation Details.  Comparison with detailed link calculations on flying missions indicates that this automated calculation is accurate to within approximately 2dB 7  S AMPLE O UTPUT  Automatic reports and charts are vital for validating data They provide a quick, visual check on data values and missing data.

Figure 10 shows the count of downlinks, missions and spacecraft from the database over the time interval: 2005-2035.  As can be seen, the number of downlinks and the number of spacecraft increase w ith time, while the actual number of missions declines.  The differences in these trends are due to the decline in the number of proposed missions and use of multi-spacecraft missions

Figure 11 show the top three mission drivers for downlink difficulty as a function of time, between 2005 and 2035.  Downlink difficulty is defined as  2 RSQ   1 Where Q is the downlink difficulty R Mbps\e data rate and S astronomical units\(AU\the Earth-spacecraft separation.

Data is collected from public information and internal reports edited, and entered in the database using automated input forms.  The data is then verifi ed for format and validated for completeness and accuracy Ephemeris tables provide accurate Earth-to-mission separation data for any time during mission operation.  The tool features automated estimates of receiving area needed on the ground to close the communications links to each satellite during each segment of operation.  Use of analysis templates allows temporary modification of database contents to facilitate rapid \223what-if\224 studies.  Using this tool, it is now possible to analyze NASA future mission sets with variations, all within hours rather than the weeks needed previously, and with better accuracy 9  A PPENDIX A  U PLINK AND D OWNLINK B UDGET C ALCULATION D ETAILS  Automated uplink and downlink calculations are performed using the formulas and default values listed below.

EIS System Network View Meta-model operations are those used for service description and must be ultimately decomposed into elementary ones \(i.e. data processing, storing and transferring are estimated through parameter values that are propagated by service invocation parameters to parameters describing application operations constituting the service description which are further propagated to parameters describing elementary operations 4.3. EIS Architecture Design Task Implementation EIS Architecture Design tasks may be supported by existing tools [20]. Systems Modeling Language \(SysML 15] is considered as the most appropriate for EIS System Network model representation and requirement engineering, since it supports the concepts of requirements and resource allocation. As a direct consequence, SysML allows the representation of requirements as model elements which means that requirements are part of the system architecture. For representation purposes, a SysML pro?le for EIS System Network meta-model \(?gure 6 mented as a plugin to MagicDraw modeling tool [2]. In order to facilitate model exchangeability, EIS System Network model is being realized in XML, which is a standard exchangeable format. In order to exchange data with speci?c software tools, model transformations will be accomplished through appropriate XSLTs developed for each tool for example as the one transforming XMI to the EIS System Network document type description \(DTD 5. Case Study In the following we discuss the case of renovating a legacy information system supporting a large-scale public organization based on the proposed concepts. The organization supports more than 350 interconnected regional of?ces and its main purpose is to provide services to the public both citizens and businesses. Regional of?ces are divided into three categories according to their size and information infrastructure requirements \(large, medium and small More than 15.000 employees work in the organization having on-line access to the legacy system. There are more than 300 different services provided to the public, while each citizen is required to register in the one belonging to his/her residential area, called residential of?ce. Some of them require the actual presence of citizens in their residential of?ce Existing system architecture is based on a fat clientserver architecture. All application logic is programmed within the client platform, while data is distributed in local database servers located in each regional of?ce. A Central database is supported in the Datacenter for data synchronization and lookup purposes. The Datacenter and all regional of?ces participate in a private TCP/IP network to facilitate ef?cient data replication. Most data related to a speci?c citizen are maintained as local data in his/her residential of?ce. Client programs access the local database to store data, while they access the central database mostly for lookup purposes. Local data are asynchronously replicated in the central database using a transaction management system \(TMS Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 to facilitate communication with the central database. The central database provides the overall view of each citizen  s record 


record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description. This was crucial in order to decide upon Intranet and Datacenter architecture. This information was collected by interviewing software developers The new system has to deal with a number of require&lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Small Regional Office oracle L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt tuxido L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt L.R.O. department tuxido Central

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
