 Information Security:  User Precautions Attacker Efforts, and Enforcement  Ivan P.L. Png  Qiu-Hong Wang ipng@nus.edu.sg  wangqiuh@comp.nus.edu.sg    Abstract  We analyze the strategic interactions among endusers and between end-users and attackers in mass and targeted attacks.  In mass attacks, precautions by endusers are strategic substitutes. This explains the inertia among users in taking precautions even in the face of grave potential consequences Generally, information security can be addressed from two angles facilitating end-user precautions and enforcement against attackers. We show that enforcement is more effective as an all-round policy to 
enhance information security Facilitating user precautions leads to increased precautions and increased end-user demand, which have conflicting effects on the total harm suffered by end-users. Hence, reduced form estimates of the impact of facilitating precautions may over- or under estimate the impact, depending on which effect is stronger. Further, in targeted attacks, the outcome of interaction between users and attackers depends on the specific cost functions. Attackers may target lowvaluation users as they take fewer precautions     1.

one of economic incentives 28 Academic scholarship has provided important normative analyses of economic incentives: how much end-users should invest in information security [12  1 3  2 1  ve nd o r  policies towards user patching d v u l n e rabilit y disclosu  d g o v e rnm e n t polic y to w a rds investigation of vulnerabilities  The normative analyses have been supported by various empirical studies showing that deterrent measures do reduce information security incidents   ecu rit y eff o rts redu c e v i ru s at tacks 5], an d government enforcement deters on-line attacks

In particular, attackers were assumed not to respond or adjust in any way to user actions.  While there has been some research into the incentives of attackers  ere h a s been little scholarly analysis of the strategic interaction between users and attackers 2 Realistically however Attackers continuously look for easy targets, those that will provide them with the maximum return on the 
time they invest in writing malicious code 3 pag e  55 Likewise, end-users adjust precautions in response to changes in attacks.  For over 22% of Straub s [4 sample, the main influence on security effort was past incidents.

 service, and 34% adjusted organizational policies  Generally, where two variables influence each other simultaneously, i.e., in the presence of bi-directional causation, a structural model is necessary to correctly identify the separate effects  Further, previous normative analyses did not distinguish between mass \(one-to-many\ and targeted one-to-one\.  Threats to information security differ in the intended scope of harm.  Mass attacks are aimed at an entire class of users, identified by technological platform, for instance, all users of a particular operating system \(e.g., Win-32, MAC, or Linux\sers of a particular browser \(e.g Internet Explorer, or Mozilla Firefox\.  The class could also be identified by business purpose, e.g., all banks or demographic characteristic, e.g., all Viagra users or all Citibank customers.  Targeted attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks, are aimed at a particular victim.  Leading security vendor, Symantec, has observed a trend Large Internet worms targeting everything and everyone have given way to smaller more targeted attacks focusing on fraud, data theft, and criminal activity  e n ce, it is i m porta n t to  understand the differences in attacker behavior and user response between mass and targeted attacks In this paper, we model the strategic interaction between end-users and attackers in the presence of government enforcement.  We consider both mass  and targeted attacks and address important issues in enduser behavior, business strategy, and public policy First, although threats to information security pose grave potential consequences, end-users seem quite sluggish in taking precautions.  For instance, among computer security professionals who experienced an intrusion, 46% did not patch the relevant ho  How can such inertia among professional IT managers be explained?  We show that user precautions against mass attack are strategic substitutes if one user increases precautions, others will have incentive to reduce their precautions The second issue concerns the strategic interaction between end-users and attackers.    Using our structural model, we show that reduced-form estimates of the impact of changes in the user cost of precaution and the enforcement rate may be too low or too high depending on the balance between conflicting effects With targeted attacks, we show that attackers target low-valuation users as they invest less in precaution than high-valuation users Third, information security can be and is addressed from two angles facilitating end-user precautions and enforcement against attackers.  Which policy should the government prefer?  We show that facilitating user precaution may have different effects in mass vis-‡-vis targeted attacks.  However, increased enforcement leads attackers to reduce attacking effort.  This suggests that enforcement is more effective as an allround policy to enhance information security  2. Background literature  The economics of information security has focused on two normative issues.  One is the policies of software vendors, CERT/CC and other security specialists to disclose security flaws and provide the appropriate patches \(for instan  1 1][17 1 8  The other strand of normative analysis has focused on the user s optimal behavior, including investment in information security arin g i n f o r m ation 8], an d  implementation of detection system In this vein odeled a pos itiv e n e t w or k externality among users in taking precautions against attack.  The expected loss to any user increases with others precautions and hence user precautions are strategic complements  For a w i de ran g e of cos t  and risk parameters, there are two equilibria either all users invest in precautions or no one does   August and Tunc con s ider th e in cen ti v e of users to patch security flaws.  In a finding that is reminiscent of the public-health literature on infectious diseases, they show that mandatory patching is not optimal.  With commercial software, the optimal policy is a subsidy on patching when security risk and patching cost are high, and no policy otherwise However, with open-source software, the optimal policy is a subsidy on patching when both security risk and patching costs are low, and a tax on software usage otherwise By contrast with the previous research, we focus on the strategic interaction among end-users and attackers Our analysis shows how users precautionary effort depends on attackers effort and vice versa Accordingly, we can show how changes in policy toward attackers will affect user behavior, and, also how policy changes toward users will influence attacker behavior  3. Basic setting  Consider the market for some service 3 which is provided by a monopoly at a uniform price p We assume a simple market structure, in order to focus on the interaction between end-users and attacker   End-users derive benefit   0 vv  from use of the service, which is distributed according to the cumulative distribution  v  with v representing   3 The analysis is applicable to software, hardware, as well as services Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2

All users are risk-neutral The vendor would set price such that  vp  else there would be no demand A user sustains an attack with probability [1f  a  where [1f  s a probabilit y t h at depen d s on t h e u s er s effort  0,1 f  in precautions such as installing patches, scanning suspicious emails, or properly configuring their firewall, and where a is a probability that depends on the attacker s effort If the user sustains an attack, she will not derive any benefit, and in addition, will incur some harm vh  4 The user s cost of effort f in precautions is C f  f  The properties of C f  f   00 f C   0 f dC df   2 2 0 f dC df   1 Each potential user decides whether to buy the service, and, if so, chooses precautions to maximize her expected net benefit 5  The attacker chooses attacking effort  0,1 a   which is the probability of successful attack without considering user s precaution. The attacker derives benefit, which could be monetary or non-monetary from an attack on a user, provided that he is not subject to enforcement.  We assume that the attacker s benefit is [1 h  v i.e., positively related to the users valuation of the service.  With probability the authorities would subject the attacker to enforcement, impose a penalty with monetary value t and prevent the attacker from realizing the benefit from attack Further, the cost of attacking effort is C a  a   00 a C   0 a dC da   22 0 a dC da  2 The attacker chooses effort to maximize his expected net benefit.  This modeling assumption is consistent with Symantec s e 55 erv a t i o n  that attackers direct efforts against targets that provide the maximum return. We further assume that attacker has no resource constraints For tractability, we assume that all attackers are identical.  Accordingly, in equilibrium, all attackers choose the same level of effort and so, are subject to enforcement with the same probability 6  Table 1 describes all the notation used in our model  Table 1.  Analytical notation  Variable Definition   4 This set-up is similar to that in the literature on enforcement against copyright piracy \(see, for instance, [3    5 We implicitly assume that end-users simultaneously decide whether to buy the service, and if so, how much effort to take in precautions In reality, end users might be myopic, and consider precautions only after purchase.  This scenario would be much simpler to analyze  6 As indicated below in equation \(7\ the probability of being subject to enforcement increases with the attacker s effort   0 vv   End user s benefit from the service v  Highest possible benefit from the service p Service price f  User s effort in precautions  0,1 f   a  Attacker s attacking effort  0,1 a   h Parameter which characterizes the additional harm vh at a user sustains from an attack in addition to losing the benefit from the service C f  User s cost of effort f in precautions C a  Attacker s cost of effort a in attacking  Authorities enforcement rate against attackers t Monetary value of the penalty imposed on attackers who are subject to enforcement  We consider two extreme scenarios that typify various forms of on-line information security attacks  Mass attacks \(one-to-many\: The attacker chooses attacking effort a and broadcasts the attack, hence applies to all end-users equally.  Examples include viruses, worms, spyware, and bots  Targeted attacks \(one-to-one\ The attacker targets individual end-users as characterized by their valuation v with effort a  v Examples include denial of service attacks, system intrusion, and pharming \(redirection of traffic from a particular web address to a bogus website Depending on the locus of the victim, some attacks may be considered to be either mass or targeted attacks.  For instance, phishing emails directed at Citibank customers may be viewed as a mass attack against Citibank customers, or a targeted attack against Citibank, being one of many banks.   Similarly pharming of the IFRCS \(International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\may be viewed as a mass attack against end-users whose computers are infected with re-direction, or a targeted attack against the IFRCS, being one of many international non-profit organizations The authorities can address information security through either facilitating end-user precautions reducing enforcement against attackers increasing ocus on the issue of information security, specifically, the interaction between end-users and attackers, and for tractability, in this study, we assume the price of the service price p to be exogenous Figure 1 shows the sequence of events.

By 3\ery user for whom B  v  0 will buy the service For mass attacks, it is relatively straightforward to prove that B  v creasing in v Accordingly, we have Observation 2 With mass attacks, either no users buy the service or there exists a marginal user v defined by   7  This simultaneous setting is similar to the Cournot model where competing producers decide on output simultaneously and noncooperatively  8 We prove all results in the Appendix    1  1  0 f Bva v p v ha f C f        5 and such that only users with vv  buy The demand for the service arises from the users with vv  hence the quantity demanded \(equal to the vendor s sales   1 m v Qdv  6 The following result shows how the demand for the service depends on attacker s effort and the vendor s price Observation 3 With mass attacks, the marginal user type v is continuous, increasing and concave in the user cost of effort in precaution the attacking effort a and the price p In addition  00 va   and  1 1 va v  where 1 01 v   Having analyzed user behavior \(choices of whether to buy the service, and, if so, effort in precaution\ as a function of the attacker s effort, we now consider the attacker s effort as a function of user behavior.

       1 11 va L ahvfvadv    9 Accordingly, the function L  a  a is the amount or harm that end-users actually suffer from attack, i.e, the effective loss of users  Lemma 1 proves the existence of equilibrium by considering the relation between L  a d the attacking effort a The conditional loss is a continuous decreasing function of the attacking effort, and similarly, the attacking effort is a continuous increasing function of the user s conditional loss Figure 2 illustrates the result Lemma 1 There exists a non-trivial equilibrium between end-users and attackers  a    va and   f va   Figure 2.  User-attacker equilibrium Our first substantive result focuses on the strategic interaction among end-users.  Proposition 1 shows that given attacker behavior, users precautions are strategic substitutes  Proposition 1 With mass attacks, given attacker behavior, user precaution efforts are strategic substitutes:  The higher the precaution efforts of others the lower will be the precaution effort of any particular individual Proposition 1 implies that a free-rider problem exists in user security.  If other users raise their precautions, they will reduce the expected harm to any particular user, and she will rationally respond by reducing her precaution.   This free-rider problem is reminiscent of that arising from concealed precautions by potential crime victims [1  th e con t e x t of information security, August and Tun als o identify a free-rider problem in user precautions.  Our result is consistent with broad empirical evidence reviewed below in Section 6, that users are slow to take precautions against mass attack Direct and indirect effects  So far, we have considered only the direct effects of changes in vendor strategy and government policy, and ignored the indirect \(feedback\ects through the actions of the other side of the situation.  To fully appreciate the effects of changes in vendor strategy and government policy, we now consider both direct and indirect effects Our analysis points to some unintended effects specifically, actions to reduce user cost of precaution such as automatic updating of patches need not enhance overall information security.  A reduction in end-user s cost of precaution has two effects on the conditional loss L increasing the end-users effort in precaution and increasing the end-user s demand for the service. The increase in demand raises the attacker s expected benefit, and so, leads attackers to increase their attacking effort, hence, increasing the conditional loss.  By contrast, the increase in end-user efforts in precautions would reduce the conditional loss, but also, induce attackers to reduce their attacking effort.  Consequently, the net impact on the users  conditional loss depends on the balance of the two effects 9  Next, consider an increase in the rate of enforcement against attackers This directly leads attackers to reduce their attacking effort.  However there is also an indirect effect: users would respond to the reduced attacking effort by reducing their precaution efforts, and the demand for the service would increase.  As reported in Proposition 2 below the net impact on the effective user loss depends on the balance of the direct and indirect effects, and is ambiguous Similarly, an increase in the price p has direct and indirect effects on the demand for the service.  It would directly reduce the demand, as users with relatively low valuation cease to buy the service.  However, an increase in price also has an indirect \(consequential effect through attackers response to user choices With fewer users of the service, the attackers would reduce attacking effort, which reduces the probability of attack and therefore raises users expected net benefit.  In turn, all users would raise precaution effort and more users would purchase the service.  Thus, the indirect effect \(from the attackers\ tends to offset the direct effect of the price increase.  Accordingly, the demand for the service is less elastic than it would   9  August and Tunca [31 e m pl o y a dis c r e te m o de l to s t udy us e r  incentives on patching and find that to offer patching rebates can enhance the security of the service.

 appear from studying the direct effect alone, and, the net impact on the effective loss is ambiguous Proposition 2 With mass attacks, the effective user loss aL is: increasing in the user cost of precaution  if the effect through lower precautions outweighs the effect through shrinking demand; and ambiguous in the rate of enforcement against attackers and the price of the service p  Table 2 summarizes the net effect of changes in the user cost of precaution enforcement rate and the price p on users precautions, attackers effort, and users demand for the service 10  Table 2.

Accordingly, they may underestimate the impact of changes in the cost of precautions or enforcement rate on effective losses and the number of attacks.  Further, since attackers respond to the aggregate effort in precaution by all users rather than the efforts of individual users, the impact of any security measure may be over-estimated if it does not reduce the overall loss of the whole user base Proposition 3 highlights these findings Proposition 3 With mass attacks, compared to the case of exogenous attacker behavior, if attacker behavior is endogenous, then: \(i\ the demand for the service is less elastic, and \(ii\ing that the effect of facilitating end-user precaution through lower enduser precautions outweighs the effect through shrinking demand, then facilitation of user precaution has a weaker impact on end-user precaution and stronger impact on demand for the service    10  The results in Table 2 follow from the proofs of Propos itions 2 and 3 as presented in the appendix  11  The up arrow represents a positive impact, while the down arrow represents a negative impact 5. Targeted attacks  In mass attacks, all end-users are subject to the same attacker effort a By contrast, in targeted attacks, the attackers design specific schemes against each targeted victim, as characterized by valuation v  With targeted attacks, the end-users behavior is 4\ With regard to attackers, we suppose that they choose attacking effort a  v maximize expected benefit as a function of the end-user valuation v         11 a Hafv v av v fv t C a   10 Maximizing H with respect to a the first-order condition is   1  1  a vfvdCada    11 We now consider how end-users and attackers respond to changes in their environment and each other s behavior Observation 5 With targeted attacks, attacking effort increases in end-user valuation v and decreases in precaution effort f  v d enforcement rate  Unlike mass attacks, however, users net benefit as measured by \(3\ not monotone in v Observation 6 reports the finding Observation 6 With targeted attacks, end-users net benefit increases in their valuation v if and only if the elasticity of attacking effort with respect to user s valuation is low enough, i.e    1 1 11 av va a h f 012  012 12 User-Attacker Equilibrium  Under targeted attacks, there are no externalities among end-users.

 Table 3 summarizes the net effects of changes in cost of effort in precaution enforcement rate and price p on users effort in precautions, attackers  effort, and demand for the service 13 In Table 3, the grey-shaded cells highlight differences in the impacts of cost of precaution and price between the scenarios of mass vis-‡-vis targeted attacks \(Tables 2 and 3 With targeted attacks, attackers direct efforts at specific victims.  An increase in the end-user cost of effort in precaution would directly lead users to reduce precautions.  Then, clearly, attackers targeting those users would increase their attacking effort. By contrast with mass attacks, the attackers adjusted their efforts in ambiguous directions With targeted attacks, the price of the service affects only the end-users purchase decision and has no impact on attacker effort, and hence, it has no effect on users effort in precaution.  By contrast, with mass attacks, an increase in the price of the service leads attackers to decrease attacking effort and end-users to decrease effort in precaution Table 3.

We have implicitly assumed that attackers have unlimited resources, hence they target any user that offers positive expected benefit, i.e H 0.   In turn, this depends on whether the user buys the service, and, if so, the user s valuation and effort in precaution Superficially, high-valuation users would seem to present good targets because of their high v However they would take more effort in precaution df  dv 0 considering both direct and indirect effects Proposition 4 shows that, under a specific condition attackers target low-valuation users.  Although their valuation is low, they take less effort in precaution Hence, on balance, attackers prefer to target lowvaluation users   13  The results in Table 3 are according to the proof of Propos ition 4 as in the appendix  Proposition 4 With targeted attacks i\ers target low valuation users if the elasticity of end-user effort in precautions with respect to their valuation is relatively high, i.e 1 1 vf fv f 012  012 13 ii\and for the service decreases in the end-user cost of effort in precaution and price p and increases in the enforcement rate  Specific cost functions  To further explore the strategic interaction between end-users and attackers, we consider two specific functional forms that have been used in previous studies of information security for the cost of end-user precaution and attacker s effort Suppose that costs are logarithmi T h en    log 1 ff Cf M f      log 1 aa Ca M a    The attacker s effort and net benefit would be constant with respect to users valuation.

   6. Implications  Propositions 1 and 4 show that the effect of one user s precautions on the precautions of others depends on the nature of attack. With mass attacks, user precautions are strategic substitutes, as also shown by  By  contrast, with targeted attacks, end-user precautions are independent of each other There is considerable empirical evidence of sluggishness among users in taking precautions.  A war-drive of residential wireless access points in a college town revealed that, despite the well-publicized risks, almost 40% of the access points were not secured   Ev en s e rv er adm i n i s t rators  w h o are professionals,, suffer from inertia.  Rescorla [7  monitored responses to the announcement of a remote buffer overflow vulnerability in Open SSL on July 30 2002: fixes were installed in 16% of the sample population within the first day, and 20% within the first week, but 60% were never fixed.  Among respondents to the Computer Security Institute s 12th annual survey who experienced an intrusion, 46% did not patch the relevant ho  T o th e ex ten t t h at th e  threats in these cases were perceived to be mass rather than targeted, the failure of some users to take precautions is consistent with such precautions being strategic substitutes some users decided to let others incur the effort to deter the attackers 14  Our analysis also has implications for the design of experiments and empirical studies.  Thus far, survey instruments and empirical measures of information security have not made clear the nature of potential attack whether mass or targeted \(see, for instance    15 3 0 Giv e n th at u s er s res pon d  differently to mass vis-‡-vis targeted attacks, it is important that survey instruments and empirical measures clearly identify the nature of the threat Secondly, our analysis shows that even for pure mass or targeted attacks, using a reduced form without consideration of the interactions between end-users and attackers may generate biased results. Particularly, a model with exogenous attacking activity may overestimate the impact of facilitating precaution on user   14  The applicability of our analysis to these settings does depend on the assumption that users were aware of other users precautions precaution effort if the effect on demand outweighs the effect on precaution, while it may over-estimate the impact on demand if the effect on precaution outweighs the effect on demand.  Table 4 summarizes the potential biases Several previous studies of information security assumed specific functional forms for the end user cost of precautions or attacker cost  25   Us ing logarithmic and quadratic functions, we have shown that the strategic interaction between end-users and attackers may be quite sensitive to the assumed cost function. With targeted attacks, attacking effort can be constant over user valuation if costs are logarithmic but concave if costs are quadratic.  Hence, findings based on specific cost functions may not be robust Lastly, the government can address information security in two ways facilitating end-user precautions and enforcement against attackers.  By comparing the combination of direct and indirect effects of the two security measures in mass vis-a-vis targeted attacks we show that facilitating end user precaution may not deter attackers in mass attacks.  However enforcement against attackers unambiguously deters attackers in both mass and targeted attacks Table 4.

Future work  Our analysis is subject to several limitations.  First, we assumed that attackers benefit is directly related to the end-users loss.  This may not accurately represent some classes of attacks such as where attackers infect end-users computers with bots which are then    B v  v 0 1 s  2 s  3 s End-users net benefit as function of v  Figure 4.

 remotely controlled to conduct malicious activities against other machines Second, with targeted attacks, we assumed that attackers had unlimited resources.  If they were subject to resource constraints, then they would select targets which offer higher expected benefit.  In this case, enduser efforts in precautions would be strategic complements. If other end-users increase their precautions, they would become less attractive to attackers, and then attackers would re-direct their effort Third, we assumed the price of the service to exogenous.  Future research could consider how the vendor would endogenously adjust price in response to changes in the security environment  8.

Since B  v monotone increasing in v the demand for the service is characterized as follows. Consider the highest valuation user with vv  By \(4\her precaution effort will be the highest among users, so is her net benefit If  0 Bv  then  0 Bv  for all 0 v  and all other users would not buy.

The complete proofs are available upon request users would buy the service, and so L 0\0. With regard to attacker s effort, by Observation 4 a is monotonically increasing in L Further, if L 0, then attacker will not target the service a 0. Since the functions L  a nd a  L are continuous as shown in Figure 2, they have a non-trivial intersection, say a  L  Proof of Proposition 1 Expanding \(8\o distinguish between the precaution of end-user v denoted f  v the precautions of all other users f      1 1   1 1      1    vv a v vfdv dC da vfvdv vfdv         A4 By \(A4\ an increase in precautions f by all other users except v would reduce the overall conditional loss represented in the brackets of the left-hand side, and hence induce attacker to reduce attacking effort.  This would imply a decreasing in the attacking effectiveness a User v adjusts her precaution following the ne t-benefit maximizing function represented by equation \(4\. A decreasing in a shifts down the left-hand side in \(4\Therefore, user v would reduce f  v   Proofs of Propositions 2 and 3 We first investigate the combined direct and indirect effects of precaution cost on attackerê effort, end-usersê precaution and demand da a a dL a dL dLdLd    012\012 012   012\012 012  A5 df d f f a da d   012 012 012 012   A6   dv d v v a da d   012 012 012 012   A7 By solving the above equations, we have 0 dv d   and 0 df d    0 da d   if and only if 0 L  012\012 or    1 1 v dv vf vfv vdv dv   012\012  012\012 A8 Increasing precaution cost has two effects: lower precaution and shrinking demand. \(A8\mplies that the attackerês effort increases in if and only if the lower precaution effect \(the right-hand side of \(A8\dominates the shrinking demand effect. \(the left-hand side of \(A8 Further  da dv v v df f f dada     012\012 012\012    012\012 012\012 012  Thus the sign of da d  is the same as the signs of dv d v  012 012 and  df d f  012 012 When the shrinking demand effect is dominated dv d v  012 012 and df d f  012 012 When the reducing precaution effect is dominated dv d v  012 012 and df d f  012 012  Following the similar process, we have 0 da d    0 dv d   and 0 df d    0 da dp   0 df dp   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
