According to features of wireless channels, this paper proposes a robust scheme using Rate Compatible Punctured Turbo RCPT\and Forward Error Correction \(FEC parity codes for video str eam distribution in wireless access environments. In the scheme, the rate of video data is adjusted based on statistics of Packet Loss Ratio \(PLR\o \(BER The RTCP feedback information to the sending end which carries bit error ratio, network packet loss ratio and transmission delay, is used to adjust the RCPT codes and FEC parity encoding. At the same time the packet video data is packed into the different size. The experime nt shows that this scheme can provide more satisfied video playback quality in 3G wireless netw orks with different bit error ratio and packet loss ratio, and also can improve overall network utilization efficiency Keywords wireless video transmission; RCPT FEC; error resilience; channel coding 1  Introduction In spite of the challenge from unreliable, timevarying and highly noisy characteristics of wireless channels, video transmission over wireless channels has become reality with the advent of 3G wireless communication systems. Now, more people focus on wireless video transmission due to the increase in consumer devices, such as multimedia information service, mobile video telephone, TV broadcast, and so on. However the satisfy video transmission over wireless networks is still a challenge because of the unreliable and dynamic characteristics of wireless networks, such as limited bandwidth, networks congestion and packet delay Video transmission in wireless channel brings forth a high bit error rate because of loss, fade, noise and interference. The research shows that the average BER in wireless channel varies between from 10-2  In In ternet, the bandwidth cannot be guaranteed and the reliability of data transmission cannot be guaranteed accordingly. If the networks is overloaded, the congestion and packet loss will be occurred[3 Rate compatible punctured turbo \(RCPT have been already considered as high rate codes in ARQ systems[4  protection for 3GPP, 3GPP2 and Digital Video Broadcasting \(DVB In order to deal with the bit errors and packet loss in 3G wireless networks, a robust video stream distribution scheme over 3G wireless networks is proposed in this paper.

 statistical information are recorded by receiver This information is feedbac k to sender to control the encoding and estimate the available bandwidth With the RS/RCPT-concatenated FEC, the video bit rate can be adjusted and the receiver can get a satisfied video quality 2  Features of Wireless Channels L The physical layer of 3G provides many methods such as power control, channel encoding interleaving and CRC parity\o But there are still error packets that are discarded by application layer even the tools have been used Therefore, 3G wireless networks cannot provide Quality of Service\(QoS 2.1 Bit Error Ratio Model The research shows that wireless channel can be described by Markov chain see Figure 2   G B P G/B P B/G P B/B P G/G G Good Channel B Bad Channel  Figure 2. 3G Bit Error Ratio Model: Two States Markov Process  We define B as the bad state of the channel \(the bit error rate is BB  G as the good state of the channel \(the bit error rate is BG transfer matrix is               G  G G  G B  B B  B G  G B  G G  B B  B P P 1 P 1 P P P P P P  and the average bit error ratio is B  B G  G G  G bit P P 2 P 1     012  2.2 Packet Loss Ratio Model Zorzie has found that the receiving of packets in fade wireless channel could be approximated by Markov model, and th e further research showed that one-rank Markov model is enough \(see Figure3  L R p q 1-q 1-p R Receive State L Loss State  Figure 3.

The importance of turbo codes is that they enable reliable communications with power efficiencies close to the theoretical limit predicted by Claude Sha ter encoding, puncturing is performed on the encoded bit-stream. The puncturing is employed suc h that the higher rate codes are embedded in the lower rate codes. The codes generated by this scheme of puncturing are called RCPT codes. RCPT codes is widely used in varying rate channel codi ng, which punctures the output of turbo codes per iodically, can realize variety channel coding in di fferent condition. Figure 4 depicts a turbo encoder composed of two identical Recursive Convolutional Code \(RSC separated by a random interleaver of size n and followed by a puncturing me chanism, where n is the size of the bit steami  Figure 4.

A possible set of matrices may take the form            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1  0               0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1  1               0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1  2               1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  8    In this scheme no systemat ic bits are punctured However, it is advantageous to extend the puncturing also to a small part of the information bits in some special cased. For simplicity the system model throughout the paper considers only turbo codes two identical const ituent codes and Viterbi decoding. Generally, RCPT can employ more than two constituent codes which are moreover not necessarily equal[10 For the RCPT codes we considered a selectiverepeat strategy and neglected finite memory or nonreliable feedback effects. So, each output of the turbo encoder is written in a block by row where any elements of a row in l is joined with particular column. Therefore, a successive transmission of colu mns indicated by l is carried out until there is no error detected from the outer code or the actural code rate is the lowest possible The bit error rate bit for puncture matrixes in the system is assigned as Table 3  Table 1 The respective rates Rc  bit  1  bit  1×10 4  4/5 1×10 4   bit  2.5×10 4  2/3 2.5×10 4   bit  5×10 4  4/7 5×10 4   bit  7.5×10 4  1/2 7.5×10 4   bit  1×10 3  4/9 1×10 3   bit  2.5×10 3  2/5 2.5×10 3   bit  5×10 3  4/11 5×10 3   bit  7.5×10 3  1/3 7.5×10 3   bit  1×10 2  3.2 Network Bandwidth Estimated TCP-Friendly Rate Control \(TFRC\quationbased end-to-end congestion control mechanism which can guarantee thoughputs of UDP streams with well TCP-Friendly features. TFRC is used to control rate of video streaming transmitting by UDP stream, which can be adop ted to detecting available bandwidth for heterogeneously accessing cl   According to TFRC, the av ailable band-width at the sending end is estimated as 2 32 1 8  3 3 3   2 L L L o L P P P T P RTT PacketSize AvailBW           where AvailBW is the available band width estimated PacketSize is the size of packet RTT is retransmission timeout P L is packet loss ratio T O is the interval of resending packets In congestion control, Additive Increase Multiplication Decrease \(AIMD\ is used to match video data transmission rate and available bandwidth, and make use of the bandwidth fairly with other application in Internet. The algorithm in this paper is derived from reference The sender adjusts the prediction of current networks return time according to the feedback packet  1   1  RT ST now RTT RTT            The predicted networks return time is composed of two parts with weights \(the we ight is 0.75\part is the networks return time of last time T T R and the other part is the return time after feedback packet is received. The instantaneous value is calculated from the sender clock. ST1 is the start time of sending packet RT  is the time for calculation and feedback packet after the receiver gets packet. now is the time when the sender receives the feedback packet. So, the instantaneous return time is RT ST1 now   3.3 Forward Error Correction FEC is usually used when many packets loss and cannot be retransmitted. Even the end-to-end FEC in application layer is less efficient than the FEC data protection in link layer especially is that different transmission channel links have different characteristics\it is indispensable in some applications. The packet FEC provides better performance especially in channel with high packet loss ratio. RFC2733 offers the end-to-end application layer usage in the packet losing circumstances The corresponding bits of different packets are XOR operated and the binary FEC is generated. The parity packet FEC mode used in this paper is described as follow: a\High packet loss rate p10 2,1\ket mode is used, b\packet loss rate p<10 k 1 k in this paper \(3,2 mode is given k is decided by fo llowing ex pressions               03  0 4 05  0 03  0 3 1  0 05  0 2 1  0 1 packet packet packet packet 012 012 012 012 k

PLS results  In order to test the validity of the mediating effect via operational alignment on process performance, we tested two alternative models containing \(1 direct links from ES, SA, GM on process performance or \(2 performance. In the first case, the R2 of process performance increased slightly from 25.4% to 26.3% with all added direct links being insignificant. In the second model the R2 dropped down to 20.9%. Consequently we can argue that operational alignment as a mediating factor contributes to the explanation of process performance  5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Further Research 5.1. Limitations  As our model was partly derived from prior work on successful alignment practices, the theoretical scope is certainly limited and especially the opportunistic selection of the governance tools is not exhaustive and can and should be substantially extended. We still decided in favor of our approach because particularly the measurement model for alignment and governance tools has been refined and validated in a previous large survey [6, 7, 8 The empirical evaluation might be subject to nonresponse and common method bias. In order to control for non-response bias, one should carefully compare the data of early and late respondents [2]. The reason is that late respondents share similarities with nonrespondents [44]. Accordingly, we compared late responding banks \(i.e. answering after the second reminder, N=27 N=55 significant differences in answering the items used in this analysis According to [53], common method bias refers to the amount of variance explained by the measurement method rather than by the constructs represented by the measures. Common method bias may be existent when the predictor and the criterion variables are taken from only one source \(Podsakoff et al. 2003 for our survey as we merely asked one person in each bank. To sufficiently address the issue of common method bias, Podsakoff et al. [53] recommend both procedural and statistical remedies. The first ones deal with the questionnaire design prior to data collection the latter ones with both detection and control of common method bias inside the data. In our survey, procedural remedies have been addressed by conducting pretests to identify complex or ambiguous items, which then were deleted or adjusted. Furthermore, we in 


then were deleted or adjusted. Furthermore, we included reverse-coded items to avoid acquiescence effects and ensured anonymity to the respondents to encounter social desirability effects. As statistical remedy, we applied Harman?s single-factor test which did not identify a single component explaining all or the majority of the overall variance extracted Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 5.2. Conclusion and Further Research  Theoretically integrating key findings from IT value, IT business alignment and IT governance research, we show the tantamount role of executive support and operational alignment from a governance perspective. Executive support directly and significantly drives not only strategy and operational alignment but also IT governance tools, and indirectly business process performance To summarize, the main findings are  The impact of IT governance mechanisms on success is mediated by strategic and operational alignment  The lack of a significant relation between strategic alignment and governance mechanisms highlights the gap between strategy and strategy implementation. Generally, it is quite obvious that strategic alignment is required as a foundation for effective IT governance, but our test results show that it is not necessarily a driver as well. Firms that are strategically aligned still need to make substantial efforts in order to implement alignment on the operational level as well and, thus, increase IT effectiveness and process performance. Of course, there might be many different reasons why a firm, which has high strategic alignment does not set up the appropriate IT governance tools, such as improper organizational structures, missing budgets and capacities, missing focus of top management due to competitive pressure and others  Executive support is strongly correlated with all alignment dimensions and governance mechanisms  What does that mean from a practitioner?s perspective First, executive support of alignment is a strong driver of all facets of alignment and intensity of the applied governance mechanisms. An analysis of the total effects of the two executive support indicators regarding operational alignment \(i.e. total effect of construct outer weight of indicator agement support for interplay between business and IT 0.320 0.117 of considerable importance. Second, strategic alignment is surely an enabler of high process performance but does not necessarily translate into success. It is thus important to actively select adequate governance tools to establish operational alignment. Focusing on the total impact of the different governance tools we assessed regarding operational alignment \(again measured by the total effect of construct * outer weight of indicator back office proactively into IT planning \(0.428 the existence of liaison units \(0.058 rewarding good interaction \(0.054 erately important Finally, we think that our results open some potentially relevant avenues for further research. Further strengthening the governance alignment nexus might help getting an even better understanding of how the IT resource can be used successfully and in particular how relational mechanisms like those mentioned above interact with strategic and structural properties of a 


interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
