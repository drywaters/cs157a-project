With the amount of web sites and documents growing even faster and site contents getting updated more and more often, focused web crawler is becoming more and more popular. In the literature, how to order the unvisited URLs was studied deeply, they calculate the prediction score is based on the unvisited URLs  ancestor, however the URLs in one web page is considered to have the same scores. In other words, they consider a web page has only one topic information. But we find the different parts of a web page have their own topic information, while they all support one or several big topics, so the URLs in different paragraphs should be given different scores based on the hierarchy relationship among them. In this paper, we parse every web page as a Dom-Tree, propose some rules in the tree aiming at extracting the relationship among different paragraphs and then present a new topic-specific web crawler which calculates the unvisited URL  s prediction score based on the web page hierarchy and the text semantic similarity. We consider three factors, firstly, we calculate the text similarity using vector space model \(VSM or paragraph as a vector in which the terms are independent. But there are relations about terms  sequences in a text paragraph; we try to using edit distance based on terms  sequences to avoid it. Thirdly, different paragraphs in a web page are contacted according to their hierarchy in a Dom-Tree. At last we combine the three factors in our crawler  s strategy and present our model Key words: Focused web crawler; Dom-Tree; Edit distance Semantic similarity I.  INTRODUCTION With the development of information technology digital information grows very fast and has more and more kinds of types. According to Forresst Research data 1], there are about 1810  bytes digital information a year all the world, Google has recalled about 8 billion web pages, the scale is about one to five hundred in the all web pages which grows 60T \(1T= 1210 day. Because of this problem, topic-specific web crawler has become more and more popular. Several search engines using focused web crawler have been generated in recent years [2]. The topic-specific web crawler collects web pages from the Internet by choosing to gather only particular pages related to a specific topic and needs small storage, they could offer higher retrieve precision and recall radio than large-scale search engines at the same time. Secondly, their updating time is very short, may provide the real-time service. Thirdly, they allow users to destine some service that satisfy themselves The focused crawler works like a spider, it traverses the web graph according to a topic-relevant ordering instead of the breadth-first or depth-first ordering. One of the major problems of the topic-specific crawler is how to assign a proper prediction score to the unvisited URLs. A novel approach is proposed called context graph in [3 which stored the information of link-hierarchies and the distance from general pages to topic web pages. But the approach is based on an assumption that common hierarchies exist on documents with the same topic. In 4], the author improves the approach, called the relevancy context graph; the distance is calculated with 


relevancy context graph; the distance is calculated with the construction of both general word and topic-specific word distributions. But in [3, 4], the points in context graph is web pages, and the distance did not reflect the semantic relevancy among points. We have proposed concept similarity context graph [5], which is constructed using the math tool formal concept analysis \(FCA the nodes are concepts which could reflect semantic relevancy. In [6], they develop a latent semantic indexing classifier that combines link analysis with text content, an improved LSI [7] which assumes the independence between terms. A learnable topic-specific web crawler is studied in [8]; their method is to concentrate on improving the next crawling process according to an interested topic. Though the crawlers mentioned above use very efficient technologies, the URLs in the same web page are assigned to the same score. Another method 9, 10] is to analyze the text near the unvisited the URL then they are assigned different scores. In [11], they calculate the prediction score by dividing a whole web page as several sections By above researches, this paper proposes a novel topic-specific web crawler based on web page hierarchy Our elicitation is from the method of meta-data extraction in the web pages. A web page is parsed to a Dom-Tree which is calculated the relationship among different paragraphs, and we use both vector space model \(VSM and edit distance in the process of calculating text similarity which could avoid the VSM  s disadvantage of independence between terms. Firstly, we extract the topic vector based on the query, and then calculate the similarity between topic vector and paragraph vector 2009 Asia-Pacific Conference on Information Processing 978-0-7695-3699-6/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/APCIP.2009.110 41820 using VSM and edit distance. Secondly, we parse the web page as a Dom-Tree, with which the relationships among different paragraphs are built. At last we present our strategy to predict web crawler We organize this paper in the following way. Section 2 recalls information about web page Dom-Tree, edit distance, and their application in information retrieval Section 3 proposes our focused crawler  s model, how to apply web page hierarchy based on Dom-Tree and the edit distance in the process calculating semantic similarity is introduced detailed. Finally, section 4 concludes the paper and puts forward our future work II. KNOWLEDGE BACKROUND We firstly recall the web page Dom-Tree and its application in web data mining, and then illustrate the edit distance which is used to calculate the text similarity A. Dom-Tree and its application Dom \(Document Object Model platform, which is organized by some hierarchy nodes or constituted of some information segments set, so it is considered as a tree, we call it as Dom-Tree. There is an html in Figure 1, and Figure 2 is the corresponding DomTree. We could recognize every web page as a Dom-Tree which reflects the web page  s internal information and is used very frequently in web information retrieval. For example, the topic of a paragraph which has more brother nodes could be more specific than others having less brother nodes, while if a node has many child paragraphs its topic will be abstract, and it will be the whole web page  s topic possibly. Dom-Tree is used in web information distilling [11, 12], they distill the web page topic using the number of brother nodes [12], the relationship of nearby nodes and nearby text paragraphs in the Dom-Tree, which has been used in some search engines. In [13], they used Dom-Tree to classify the web pages and exclude the same pages  Figure 1.  An html web page code 


Figure 1.  An html web page code  Figure 2. The Dom-Tree that corresponds to the web page in Figure 1 B. Edit distance Edit\(s, t s, where t and s are two strings, the operator include  insert    delete  and  replace  the operator number is the two strings  edit distance [14]. It is used very frequently to calculate the two strings  similarity. People traditionally calculate the edit distance with the unit of word. For example, Figure 3 shows the two strings edit distance is four, in fact, the two strings is very similarity so there are many disadvantages with the unit of word in Chinese. In [15], they develop the method using unit of term instead of unit of word or character, while using the resource of Hownet and synonymous words to calculate the terms  similarity and giving the different weights to different operators according the language similarity among the similar terms. Their method uses every term  s deep information to mines the terms which is different in external but the same in meanings, considering the terms   sequences and language similarity in case of not parsing the paragraph and not filtering their diversities, which is proved to adapt to calculate the similarity of Chinese paragraph. A development is presented combing the edit distance and Chinese text syntax [16]. In [17], they construct a classier considering the edit distance as stochastic process  Figure 3. The edit distance of two Chinese strings III. THE FOCUSED CRAWLER WITH WEB PAGE HIERARCHY BASED ON HTML DOM-TREE In this section, we illustrate our focused crawler strategy specifically. We mainly discuss three parts several rules which will be used in our strategy are presented through parsing the web page into its corresponding Dom-Tree firstly. Then we illustrate two steps to calculate text similarity, one is base on SVM which terms are independent in and they are calculated using the term frequency and inverse document frequency TF-IDF  similarity is calculated using edit distance which is thought about the terms  sequences in the text sentence, the two steps are one by one because there are sequences among terms when they appear at the same time firstly. At last, our focused crawler strategy is presented according to the above two parts. We will study the three main parts respectively in the flowing subsections A. Three rules based on HTML Dom-Tree People usually write the title of a paper firstly, several big paragraphs which are used to explain the title are written, then many small paragraphs are written to illustrate the above big paragraphs correspondingly, and the paper is over with the rest may be deduced by analogy. So the relationships are existed among paragraphs, but the two close paragraphs  similarity may be small, we sum up the different relationships in the following 41921 We illustrate two concepts which are father-child and brother-brother between two paragraphs in the HTML Dom-Tree which could reflect the hierarchy relationship definitely. The brother-brother paragraphs  relationship is rather low because they are all used to explain their father node in different aspects. While the father-child paragraphs  relationship may be very high in case of people write the child paragraph to support the view of father paragraph Definition 3.1 \(Father-child paragraphs paragraphs, if a paragraph is the other  s father node in a Dom-Tree, we call them father-child paragraphs Definition 3.2 \(Brother-brother paragraphs or more paragraphs, which have the same father node in a Dom-Tree, then we call them brother-brother paragraphs 


We present three rules according the above understandings as following Rule 1 The URLs  score in the top node of Dom-Tree would be related to not only the content of the node, but also the similarity between the query and the tag title of the web page Rule 2 The URLs  score in other nodes of Dom-Tree would relate to the content of the node and its father node, in another word, its father node would add weight to the URLs Rule 3 We consider the meaning of a node  s parent node is more abstract if the node has more brother nodes than others, so its parent node should add less weight on it The three rules are extracted based on the Dom-Tree and we will apply it to the formula of the similarity calculation B. Similarity calculation There are two methods for calculating text similarity one is to use SVM which consider every word is independent, and the other use edit distance which considers the sequences between terms. The differences are what, the former uses the term frequency and inverse document frequency \(TF-IDF paragraphs  similarity, and the latter considers not only whether the terms appear, but also the terms  sequences in the text sentence. We discuss how to apply the two methods to calculate similarity. First of all, we select the eigenvector which could describe a paragraph in the process of using SVM, and then we amend the edit distance for our model We use cosine to calculate the similarity, in another word, tow paragraphs are considered two vectors, and the similarity between the two vectors reflects the two paragraphs  relevancy. In our model, there are two questions, one is the length of queries input by users is usually rather short, while the text paragraph is usually long, so it is not right if we consider the two vectors   cosine similarity directly. The other is the variety of people  s thinking methods, even though users who want to search the same content could input different queries We extend the query through getting the top pages in Google and Baidu, cutting words and calculating the TFIDF, at last select top n terms as the vector of the query according the weight of TF-IDF Definition 3.3 \(TF-IDF in the document i  is defined as follows  2  kikik nNLogtfW             \(1 Where iktf  is the frequency of the term k in the document i 2 +knNLog  is the IDF value of term k, N presents the cardinalities of the set of all documents and kn  is the cardinalities of the set which term k is in Definition 3.4 \(Cosine similarity vectors i  and j, then the cosine similarity between them is defined as follow      ji jijijiSimV    2 Where i  is the extended vector of a query input by a user using our method, j is the vector of a document, the numerator is their inner products and the denominator is the product of two modules of two vectors The text similarity is not only related to the frequency of terms, but also the sequences among the terms, we would calculate the similarity based on that the orders between terms in the query appearing in the text paragraph, at the same time, present our edit distance 


paragraph, at the same time, present our edit distance similarity method which would be used in our model Definition 3.5 \(the division part of text paragraph, which include the most of terms in the query in the case of edit distance between two terms is less than ? , which is a const Definition 3.6 \(the distance of a division as a division, and the distance of the division is defined as follow     1 1 1  tan n i iiI nmtermtermlevceDis ?     \(3 Where m is the number of terms in a query,  n is the number of query  s terms in the division I  1+ii termtermlev is the edit distance between two closed terms, and the edit distance here only include the number of interval terms and changes between terms is the const which is presented in Definition 3.5 Definition 3.7 \(edit distance similarity q and a text paragraph p, then we defined the edit distance between them as follows  min1 1  1 I N I ceDis pqSimL    4 Where I is a division, N is the number of divisions in the query p Example 1 Given a query q as  ABCD  and a text paragraph p as  AxCxxDxxxBAxxCD    x  presents a not relevant term. The divisions and their edit distance are showed as follows Division 1: AxCxxDxxxB? 1tan ceDis ?1+2+3+1+1=8 Division 2: CxxDxxxBA? 2tan ceDis ?2+3+1+1+1=8 Division 3: DxxxBAxxC? 3tan ceDis ?3+2+1+1=7 Division 4: BAxxCD? 4tan ceDis ?2+1=3 4202  pqsimL  =  0.25 C. The scheme of crawling In the before two subsections, we analyze the DomTree and the similarity calculation methods, and we will use them to predict the score of unvisited URLs in this subsections Definition 3.8 \(the similarity between a node in a Dom-Tree and a query node in a Dom-Tree as p, then we defined the similarity between them as follows      pqsimLpqsimVpqScoreP ?? ?+=    \(5  Where pqsimV  is the cosine similarity between q and the node p pqsimL is the edit distance similarity between them, ? is a weight, such that 10 Definition 3.9 \(Prediction score an unvisited URL U in the node N which is in a DomTree as D, and the U  s prediction score is described as follows

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we present a novel topic-specific web crawler based on web page hierarchy, and propose the method of similarity calculating based on VSM and edit distance which could avoid the VSM  s disadvantage of independence between terms. The web pages are parsed to Dom-Trees, which could be used to calculate the relationship between paragraphs and used very often in information extraction. We present several rules which are used during the similarity calculation in our model base on Dom-Tree, with which the relationships between different paragraphs are found out. At last we present our strategy to predict our crawler In the future works, we will study different kinds of web pages  characteristics which could reflect the relations of paragraphs, and would be joined in our model ACKNOWLEDGMENT Work herein reported was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No 60872089, the Nature Science Project of the Education Department Foundation of Sichuan Province of China under Grant No.2006A086, the Application Foundation of Science &amp; Technology Bureau Sichuan Province

functionalities described above. In [36, 37 it is described the experiment of serving medical data images stored in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine \(DICOM o rm at ov er t h e Grid a n d  make them available in a trusted way to a set of hospitals participating in the experiment SNIA/XAM enabled technology has still not been exploited for Health Care purposes. We intend to provide a prototype where XAM enabled storage elements will be used to manage Health Care metadata information  8. Validation of Solutions  The interoperability between various standards and the exchange of data amongst different resources constitutes an importan t issue in Health Care applications Standards allow institutes to transmit clinical data and images from the electronic patient folder to different hospital sites requiring these elements for diagnosis, medical studies and treatment Medical image examination is a subset of the medical folder that includes images, prescription, reports of specimen analysis and other elements  A system called ETICS eInfrastructure for Testing Integration and Configuration of Software 39, 40, 41  bee n des igne d to aut o mate the inves tigation o f  the interoperability between various standards and the exchange of data among different resources.  It provides a service for software projects and infrastructures by integrating well-established procedures, tools and resources in a coherent framework and adapting them to the special needs of distributed software These tools help improving the interoperability of software applications and middleware components, evaluating software by comparing it with published standards and validating the portability of the software across different operating systems  The ETICS system is addressed to projects developing Grid and distributed software to help them define processes, methodologies and tools to implement static and dynamic analysis \(such as evaluating the adherence to user defined coding conventions, making custom analysis like IPv6 compliance, evaluating the code coverage for unit tests\ertheless, the ETICS system is equally oriented towards non-Grid projects  plementation of how the ETIC S  system supports interoperability issues is described taking into consideration the DICOM standard      9. Conclusions  In this work we have identified the Grid services that could facilitate the integration and interoperation of Health Care data and frameworks world-wide While many of the current Health Care Grid projects address issues such as data location and description on the Grid and the security aspects the problems connected to data storage, integrity, preservation and distribution have been neglected. We have identified the currently available Grid storage services and protocols that can come in handy when dealing with those problems. We are planning to make available a prototype infrastructure using EGEE gLite as a proof of concept for implementing our ideas In the future, we envisage using the existing EGEE gLite infrastructure deploying the additional Grid services identified in this paper in order to provide a Grid platform for the distribution and sharing of medical information. We have identified a few medical communities that have expressed interest in exposing their data into this proposed Grid infrastructure  References   I F o st er C Kessel m an  an d S  T u ecke  The Anatomy of the Grid: Enabling Scalable Virtual Organizations In International Journal of Supercomputer Applications vol 15, no. 3, pp. 200 222, 2001 http://www.globus.org/research/papers/anatomy.pdf 2 V Bre ton, K  D e a n a nd T  So lom onide s   The Healthgrid White paper In Proceedings of Healthgrid 2005 \(From Grid to HealthGrid\, IOS Press, vol. 112, pp. 249-321, 2005  W  L e ist e r S  M a zah er J I Vestgrd en  B  Jo h a n s en    B.

Further research could investigate how these improved standards in the field of electronic invoicing further affect the buyer-seller relationships The main limitation of our study is that it focuses on one single company. To extend the current study we have already conducted preliminary interviews in seven companies and two public organizations  7.

  12 5  C ONCLUSIONS  The investigations in this report yield three important conclusions for improving valid ation and verification of aerospace systems\222 performance requirements, and suggest a number of investigatory extensions. The improvements should be extensible to validation and verification of any performance requirement for any aerospace system Verification Planning Usi ng Conditional Approaches Reduces Numbers of Tests Required Conditional approaches are used as the basis for applying decision theory. Veri fication for aerospace systems always supports the decision making process for acceptance of the system. Therefore, verification planning using conditional approaches is suitable and appropriate for aerospace systems As demonstrated in section 2 of this report, conditional approaches can be used with models of maximum objectivity to eliminate most, if not all, questionable assumptions. This is not possible when developing a verification plan using classical statistical methods. As observed with the Orion LAS mission assurance requirement example, the use of maximum objectivity models in verification planning did not introduce any unnecessary inherent conserva tism, producing verification plans using fewer numbers of tests, with higher probabilities of verification success than those developed using classical statistical methods. This results in more cost feasible verification plans due to the reduced numbers of tests that need to be performed Requirements Validation is Improved by Using Historical Data When considering verification planning for a stringent aerospace system requirement, hi storical surrogate systems data may be used with conditional methods to investigate actual achieved requirement performance levels in both verification and operations as a function of residual risk Surrogate systems that were fiel ded, were verified to satisfy their performance requirements at stated verification risk levels, and were cost feasible in design, manufacturing, and verification. Conditional approaches allow this validation process to be performed without any knowledge of the actual requirements levied on the surrogate systems, and without using any indefensible assumptions As was observed in this report for the proposed mission assurance requirement for the Orion LAS, 41 surrogate systems actually performed close to the Orion LAS requirement in operations considering the aggregated data However, none of these surrogate systems were verified to the level of the proposed Orion LAS mission assurance requirement with the stated residual verification risk. This suggests that the industry that produced the surrogates, and that will produce the Orion LAS, may indeed design and built such systems to perform at levels that cannot be verified at those levels at a feasible cost. Relaxing the stringency of the Orion LAS mission assurance requirement to the 0.97 level for verification purposes should be valid based on results from processing the aggregate surrogate systems data Further, consider that the Ares I rocket will be designed manufactured, and verified by the same industry that does so for the Orion LAS. A 0.97 mission assurance for the Ares I means that there is a 3% risk of failure. The Orion LAS with a mission assurance requirement of 0.97 has a 3 risk of failing, given that the Ares I fails. With these values for mission assurance requirements for both vehicles, the actual risk of loss of crew due to failure of the Orion LAS when the Ares I fails is the product of these two risks, a 0.09% risk When ground test and flight data from surrogate systems is available, conditional approaches may be used to validate both the level of required performance and required maximum acceptable verification risk for the system of interest Greater Verification Plan Achievability and Feasibility Results from Combining Conditional Approaches with Historical Data Beyond the improvements offered to verification planning when using conditional approaches, the cost feasibility can be further improved if historical surrogate system data are available. As seen for verification of the Orion LAS mission assurance requirement in Table 5, once relaxed to a validated level, a verification plan taking advantage of the historical surrogate systems\222 ground test data can be developed that can be cost feasible, with a greatly improved probability of verification success Extensions to the Investigations Conditional approaches may be used to predict future system performance based on observed data, i.e., test results 7 n s id erin g th at an ticip ated use of the Orion LAS may be limited to fewer than 100 flights, it is possible to predict the probabilities for number of failures of the Orion LAS among a fixed number of flights, given numbers of surrogate ground test and fli ght successes and failures and actual Orion LAS verification results. Factoring these results into verification planni ng, coupled with requirements validation based on processing surrogate data using conditional approaches, may yield further improvements in cost feasibility for verification of stringent requirements for aerospace systems

well as from practitioners, is available, IL strategy including DWH/BI strategy IL strategies are addressed at all, either actual artifacts/documents are proposed without an integrating meta model/methodology, or the strategy making process is described without proposing specific and consistent result templates/structures Since it consumes a significant amount of resources and may constitute significant potentials for business, IL needs strategy. IL strategy must not be limited to hardware/software selection and architectural considerations, but should address the entire business scope of sourcing services, integrating acquired and self-made services into customer-oriented IL solutions, and delivering such solutions to create customer value Our survey of the state of IL strategy in practice reveals that IL sourcing, IL delivery and IL portfolio strategies are regarded as important strategy components. The larger companies are, the more international their focus is, and the more their IL is organized according to the CC model, the more components of a supply-chain oriented explicit IL strategy they are likely to have deployed The IIM model provides a suitable conceptual foundation for structuring such strategy components and also provides best practices from IT management which often can be easily adapted to IL. Regarding IL product/service development and maintenance certain functional oriented strategy sub-components are differentiated in our framework. These strategy components are adapted from an established data management functional framework in order to reflect IL specifics. While traditional, more technically oriented sub-components such as system and data architecture are covered in most companies, business oriented components like change management and project/business requirements management are covered less frequently. Additional research is necessary to develop appropriate solution components based on existing fragments and experiences Based on a more complete comprehension of IL strategy and its components, the strategy development and update process needs to be addressed in future research as well. Instead of developing and updating business strategies, IT strategies and IL strategies in independent processes, dependencies and cycles need to be addressed. A comprehensive understanding of IL strategy and respective processes may also serve as a foundation for establishing maturity models, reference models and best practices  References 1] Arnott, D. and G.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
