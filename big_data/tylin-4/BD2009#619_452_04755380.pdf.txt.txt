Introduction  A ?digital pen? \(DP on specially patterned paper, records a digital facsimile of whatever one writes [1]. The digitized writing may be downloaded to a PC to be filed, reviewed, printed or converted to text. In this paper, we review a yearlong research project that explored potential consumer uses for this technology The Anoto Group has produced an extensive developer platform for DP technology [1] and their technology has been commercialized by Logitech [12 Livescribe [11], and other device and solutions providers. Perhaps the most obvious use case for DP technology is general note-taking. For instance students might take notes in a class notebook, or professionals might take notes during a meeting with colleagues or customers. However, adoption by consumers of DP for general note-taking has to date been very limited. In this paper, we review a series of overlapping consumer research studies and present findings that suggest why consumer adoption is low Other use cases for DP technology involve two general categories of usage. First is structured data collection, such as writing parking tickets, taking structured medical notes, or filling out an inspection form, where the information is linked to a specific workflow and database application. Second is annotation, where a printed document is marked up corrected, or amended with digital ink. These are 


corrected, or amended with digital ink. These are interesting and significant applications that we hope to report on in the future. For the present paper we limit our attention to note-taking applications In our usage, ?note taking? with DP can be defined as follows: a consumer uses a DP device and paper to create written artifacts of any type for their own individual usage \(either for work or personal purposes and the digitized facsimile is downloaded to a PC for archiving or review by the writer There has been little published research on broad behavioral analysis of digital pen usage and related technologies for note taking. Prior research falls into three general categories: \(1 models for digital documents, such as marking up printed documents for editing or using paper as a control device \(e.g., [6][7][10][13][17 2 applications that address specific, well-defined use cases, such as input of medical information [3] or user authentication by signature [18]; and \(3 technologies that may be used to implement basic functionality or middleware for DP systems [1][5]. A separate research issue involves the psychological operation and impact of note-taking, apart from technological concerns \(e.g., [8][9 solely on the behavioral aspects of note-taking that are important for DP technology usage and design. To our knowledge, there has been no large scale exploration of basic note-taking behavior and the implications of such behavior for DP technology in general  2. The Digital Pen Interaction Model  To understand user response to DP technology, it is important to examine several fundamental aspects of the DP interaction model and to recognize how these differ from the traditional pen and paper equivalents We describe the most common Anoto functionality Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE model here [1]; other DP systems have other interaction models, generally more restrictive than the Anoto model cartridge and a battery-powered, camera-based scanning system, packaged in a single unit that resembles a large ballpoint ink pen The pen detects location on paper by reading a pattern pre-printed on the paper using a proprietary encoding scheme. Briefly, this coding scheme allows the pen to know where it is on a page \(X/Y coordinates on, among a large space of possible pages. Pages may be duplicated within this space; this points to one of the important differences between DP and traditional pen and paper usage. One mass-market DP product Logitech io2 Digital Pen [12 pre-printed DP pattern pages, but every notebook with the same colored cover is identical. This means that when one writes in two different notebooks with the same cover color, the DP product cannot distinguish which notebook one is using without other information A manufacturer may address this ?space management problem in various ways, for instance, by asking users to check a box whenever they switch to a different notebook or disambiguating content post hoc through timestamps or user inquiry DP patterned paper cannot reliably be reproduced it must be purchased pre-printed, or, if the DP product supports this capability, printed on demand. Simply photocopying pages does not work reliably Notes taken with DP may be downloaded to a PC 


Notes taken with DP may be downloaded to a PC where they can be reviewed, archived, printed, or converted from handwriting to computerized text. The primary interface for such notes is simply viewing them as facsimiles of written documents, perhaps organized by date, topic, or keywords Finally, of course, users only benefit from the system when they take notes using both a charged and functional DP pen unit along with appropriately patterned paper. Using the pen on non-patterned paper or writing on patterned paper with another ballpoint pen \(perhaps indistinguishable in appearance result in no data collection  Table 1: Summary of the digital pen HCI research activities  Research project Location\(s Collect instrumented data on writing characteristics US, Japan Adult PC users N=25 US=17, JP=8 Ethnographic interviews knowledge workers US, Japan Enterprise knowledge workers N=16 US=12, JP=4 Ethnographic interviews college students US Full-time university students N=19 Focus groups on usage scenarios US, Japan Adult knowledge workers 18 focus groups N=4-10 in each group Field trials of DP product: college students amp; knowledge workers US Full-time university students and full-time office workers N=15 7 students, 8 knowledge workers Enterprise site visits US, Japan Canada, India Enterprise IT administrators and end users N=28 organizations US=20, JP=6, CA=1, IN=1 Usability studies on product form, patterned paper, and other aspects US, Japan Adult PC users N=20 US=12, JP=8 reported in this paper  3.

For convenience we divide the research into two general categories consumer research, i.e., investigation of the utility of DP technology for individual users who might adopt Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 the technology, and enterprise research technology might be adopted in o corporate needs for record keeping o This is largely a heuristic distinction dividing line between individual and c taking.

Most said they would pay $10 or less and none said he or she would pay more than $25  3.3.3. Implications for DP. The primary finding is that existing behavior with pen and paper fits most people?s needs well and is difficult to change. People experience significant advantages from the ability to use any paper, from any source, with existing pens; to be able to use existing writing devices with any paper-based document; the ready availability of pens pencils, and paper in their common environments and the low cost of traditional pens and papers Using DP requires attention to one specific pen and one kind of paper. Given the low perceived benefit of PC-based review of notes, most users had little incentive to engage in such a change in behavior The low stated value and nearly unanimous abandonment of product usage in this trial imply that adoption of similar products would likely be low  


 3.4. Research Series 4: Enterprise Site Visits  3.4.1. Method. The research team identified 28 organizations that represented a breadth of industries that were expected either to be significantly interested in DP note-taking applications for individual employees \(e.g., professional services expected to be largely uninterested \(e.g manufacturing team visited in person if possible \(N=23 scheduled conference calls with representatives N=5 interviewed both individual knowledge workers and IT management who were responsible for knowledge worker productivity systems.

Findings. The breakdown of organizations visited is shown in Table 2. Among the organizations 8/28 expressed high interest in DP technology principally in professional services, law, and education and research organizations. Common penrelated artifacts in those organizations were personal notes taken during meetings \(either internal meetings or client meetings do lists; and business-related drawings \(charts engineering drawings, architectural sketches, etc  Table 2: Summary of Organizations Visited  Line of business US  Outside US Finance N=3 N=2 \(Japan Insurance N=1 N=1 \(Japan Healthcare N=3 N=1 \(Japan Law N=3 Professional services and consulting N=2 N=1 \(India N=1 \(Canada N=1 \(Japan Transportation and manufacturing N=4 Education and research N=2 Government services N=2 Publishing  N=1 \(Japan  Organization size US  Outside US Medium \(100-999 employees N=3 N=1 \(Japan N=1 \(Canada Large \(1000-9999 employees N=6 N=3 \(Japan N=1 \(India Very large \(&gt;10000 employees N=11 N=2 \(Japan  The key benefits of DP technology were viewed as retention of information for intellectual property Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 backup, assurance of regulatory compliance issues e.g., documentation for patents 


search for information \(assuming handwriting recognition within centrally archived DP documents Among work artifacts, we observed frequent mixture of work-related and personal information on a single piece of paper \(for instance, meeting notes together with personal reminders frequently taken on environmental paper \(meeting handouts, the unprinted side of discarded documents sheets of copy paper, note pads, etc freely mixed text and drawings In some cases, text was mixed between a native language and a foreign language or other linguistic context. For example, engineering and research organizations often included mathematical symbols healthcare facilities used many abbreviations, drug names, chemical terms, and Latin phrases themselves often abbreviated terms were often borrowed from German and English A frequent observation in business settings was the free availability and exchange of pens: people could expect offices and meeting rooms to have extra pens available such that there was little need to possess a personal pen. Participants also reported frequently losing pens Another striking observation was the sheer prevalence of paper documents. As Sellen &amp; Harper noted in The Myth of the Paperless Office [16], paper provides an interaction model that is well optimized for many uses and appears to be growing, not shrinking, in importance as offices are increasingly handling digital documents. In many cases, we observed the sheer exposed surface area of paper documents in an office \(e.g., the tops of document piles on a desk screen We observed significant cultural differences between the US and Japan. In Japan, knowledge workers reported attending fewer formal meetings than in the US, and it was common for meetings to have a dedicated note taker ? often a junior employee who produced formal notes \(minutes attendees. Thus, individual note taking in meetings appeared to be less necessary in Japan than in the US although the automation value of DP for the specified note-taking employee might be high Multi-color ballpoint pens appeared to be popular in Japan. In our individual sessions in Japan Research Series 2 above participants to have three-color retractable ballpoint pens. Ink colors were used for idiosyncratic patterns of content differentiation, e.g., separating facts recorded in a meeting from personal conjectures by writing them in different colors This pattern of writing with color was also observed during our enterprise site visits in Japan and suggests that DP technology may need to provide a simple way to meet the need for ad hoc content differentiation that color provides. Finally, signatures in Japan are generally given with a personal ink stamp \(?hanko This is a more important consideration for formal documents using DP than for note taking, but the need to implement a ?digital hanko? was a common observation of participants We also observed user-perceived barriers that were specific to various lines of business. For instance, in the Japanese insurance industry insurance agents are independent and sell policies for multiple companies; a single insurance company would find it difficult to require agents to work with proprietary DP technology. In US medical settings, a common concern was compliance with the 


common concern was compliance with the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA information privacy. Organizations were unsure whether DP products would be HIPAA compliant and even if the products themselves were secure whether their onboard information could be kept secure when the pens are small and easily lost  3.4.3. Implications for DP. Although there was substantial interest in DP technology among professional services and white collar organizations the ethnographic findings suggest that delivering appropriate value from DP technology would be difficult. The first barrier would be providing a platform that either conforms to or changes current behaviors around pen and paper: free availability of pens and unpatterned paper in the workplace behaviors of writing on environmental paper, and the need to keep up with a personal pen with one?s data The second barrier would be to meet expectations around text; much of the value was seen as being in retention and searching of textual information, but this would be made difficult by the frequent inclusion of acronyms, abbreviations symbols, and foreign languages. Many organizations saw value in centralized repositories that would manage DP information across many employees; this would require an IT infrastructure that was not available \(e.g., to manage the DP pattern space might be difficult and expensive to develop and maintain. It also poses questions about privacy, since employees might not wish the archive to retain personal information captured alongside work notes Finally, because we noted real or perceived barriers that were highly specific to various industries it appeared that DP solutions would be most likely to succeed if they were tailored to very specific settings Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 and use cases. This does not argue against DP usage and its value, but it suggests that delivering value to organizations may require substantially more design and development effort than a single general solution or platform would provide  4. Discussion  Our findings show that the interaction model of DP technology diverges substantially from common pen and paper usage. This divergence leads to unclear utility of DP for consumer note-taking purposes, and in a field trial, resulted in high abandonment rate of a consumer DP product. Among the most significant limitations were the low value seen in review of facsimile notes on a PC, the requirement with DP to use a special pen paired with patterned paper, and the low perceived value of capturing only notes taken on blank paper as opposed to handouts and other materials. In the enterprise space, the environmental issues were even more prominent due to the common infrastructure of freely available, communal pens and paper and the lack of IT infrastructure for DP document retention The note-taking research reported here suggests that writing behavior comprises many important areas besides capture, retention, and review of specific data. For instance, a single blank piece of paper or a one-word reminder may adequately serve as a reminder to do something that one intends, even though there may be little or no content as such Likewise, in interpersonal contexts such as attending 


Likewise, in interpersonal contexts such as attending a lecture, it may be socially desirable to take notes even if they are later simply disposed. Taking notes may also serve purposes of memory consolidation even when the content is never reviewed [8][9  4.1 DP and Writing Acts  Linguistic acts in social context have been described using a model of performative behavior commonly known as ?speech acts? theory [15 Chapman [2] extended that model to encompass writing, suggesting that many aspects of ?writing acts are unique and separate from spoken language.  In the extended model, writing acts may be described with a multidimensional taxonomy encompassing a writer?s context, aspects of the process, type of content, and linguistic features of the content Table 3 summarizes the dimensions of writing acts \(from [2 exemplify each dimension. For instance, ?separability denotes the extent to which items in a document are logically independent of one another; in a contract nothing is separable because the document is a single piece, while on a to-do list, many or all items may be independent of one another [2 DP technology may benefit from attention to the dimensions that are exemplified by writing acts embedded in social contexts. DP systems may be able to perform some kinds of writing acts quite well, but in other cases, DP may be inconvenient, unnecessary or inappropriate. Models such as the writing acts framework can be used both to understand user behavior broadly and systematically to explore the applicability of DP products across the general space of writing behavior A key problem for DP in note taking applications is that note taking can involve nearly every possible dimension of writing acts. Notes may be separable or not; they may serve as functional content or as contextual reminders; they may present just the facts? or be more interpretive; they may be transient or might be intended to be archival documents; and so forth. In short, notes are able to present a vast array of writing styles that pose substantially different value propositions and technological implications for DP products Delivering a general DP solution for note taking may therefore be expected to be difficult  Table 3: Dimensions of Writing Acts [2  Dimension Exemplars Separability a contract vs. a to-do list Function a typed inventory list vs calligraphy Emotionality a love letter vs. a packing slip Spatiality a transcript of speech vs. a diagram depicting concept relationships Associativity notes from class vs. doodling Linearity chronological notes vs. notes placed in a spatial ordering scheme Originality an essay vs. feedback on a manuscript Prescriptivity a signature vs. general notes Finality a document that will be archival vs. one that is a draft Structure a grocery list vs. concepts from a brainstorm Personality a letter to someone vs. a 


Personality a letter to someone vs. a journalistic essay Formality a business letter vs. a greeting card to a close friend  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 For product development purposes, the writing acts framework can be used to ensure coverage of use cases by generating possible scenarios combining various attributes of written documents. These potential combinations may then be explored evaluated, and prioritized for research attention development effort, or testing  4.2 Possible Directions for DP Technology  4.2.1. Note taking. What would make DP technology more popular for note taking? Our research suggests that this is a complex question because there are numerous behavioral barriers. The largest single problem for DP may be that it is a closed system comprising a special pen and patterned paper and does not function with the wide array of writing utensils and paper products that people use especially for environmentally available pens, paper and documents. If this problem could be solved or mitigated through an expanded DP technology platform, DP would avoid the large behavioral block posed by the current need for users to change their existing pen and paper habits DP effectively focuses on notes as data neglecting many aspects of the embedded social nature and process function of notes. If DP notes were easily integrated into a wider range of behavioral processes, adoption should increase. For example, if notes could be automatically handled for content such as phone numbers, appointment times reminders, temporary content, and the like, then the DP platform would come closer to matching current pen and paper usage. However, in many cases, there is a separate and larger issue: computer technology today also is not integrated into such processes. To take a simple example, consider a written grocery list Even if the problem could be solved to recognize extract, and transfer the list to a PC, it would be of little use because, for most people, the PC itself is not integrated into the grocery shopping process. Much information of this kind is transient; there is no need to manage or retain it once the paper has been used An example of potentially closer workflow integration is shown in the recently released Livescribe Pulse Smartpen [11], which couples the Anoto DP platform with audio recording such that note takers can review the audio of a meeting or lecture at the exact point that a note was written. We believe that these kinds of additions to base DP functionality are likely to appeal to specific niches of users, but as more use cases like these are enabled over time, DP may successively attain value for larger numbers of users In our field trials and organizational visits, one of the most common customer expectations was that DP notes should be converted from handwriting to text; respondents commonly noted that PC data is of little use unless it is transcribed to text. To meet customer demands, a DP product will need to address this expectation: the DP must either deliver text recognition with very high accuracy, which is a difficult problem, or it should manage the expectation in some other way that preserves customer perception of value from PC integration 


of value from PC integration The high cost of DP products \(approximately US 100 for a pen, plus the need for specially patterned paper demonstrable additional benefit. Transferring notes from paper to a PC today merely involves typing Unless the need for automation is great and the DP function is nearly perfect, users may simply prefer to type or to carry paper rather than to change behavior to use expensive and less flexible technology  4.2.2. Structured input. As noted in the Introduction above, another use case for DP technology is structured input of information. In particular, DP technology may be useful for form-based input into database and workflow systems, where information is initially recorded on paper forms and then automatically transferred from the pen to a database application. Although the present research report is concerned primarily with note taking applications, in the course of our enterprise research we discussed potential applications for forms-based DP usage We noted possible use cases that fell into five general areas: \(1 easier input of information by customers, such as clients filling out deposit or withdrawal slips at a bank; \(2 information from paper to database without needing to rekey or type the information, such as factory inspection and quality assurance logs, traffic tickets shipping manifests, and so forth; \(3 environments that were not suitable for handheld computing devices, such as construction sites and some kinds of manufacturing facilities; \(4 in which paper-based records are desirable for either employee compliance or customer comfort, such as medical settings; and \(5 based records are necessary, e.g., for legal reasons but a DP product could support faster turnaround and error correction. An example of such application involved financial forms that undergo offsite optical character recognition; a DP system might allow immediate recognition and error correction We plan to report this line of research fully in the future. For now, we note that each of those areas has various benefits and potential limitations with regard to DP technology. Forms-based use cases are more precisely defined and structured than note taking, in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 terms of environment, workflow, and content; the information context, form design, and potential for systems integration with rapid feedback may mitigate issues with handwriting recognition; and enterprise customers may be less price sensitive than consumers Thus, structured input appears to be a more promising near-future application of DP technology than note taking  4.3 Research Discussion  As we noted above, the present research was primarily behavioral and qualitative. Thus, despite the strength and consistency of our results across multiple samples, contexts, and locations, we present no specific metrics or tested hypotheses on user behavior with DP products. Our findings could be used to inform directional hypotheses for future depth or quantitative research. For instance, one might formulate and test hypotheses about cultural differences, interest levels in DP between various groups such as professional and non-professional 


office workers, market research metrics such as price sensitivity, and the like It is important to underscore the value of ethnographic fieldwork in the present research. It would be possible to conduct design research that explores how to make DP technology better, e.g., in terms of usability and function, without investigating exactly what people would do with such products and why. It was only when we investigated behavior in depth that we discovered the divergence of DP products? limited current value for note taking, as opposed to the high value that one might presume in the absence of depth research  5. Conclusion  In our research, initial trials of digital pens in a controlled setting \(Research Series 2 above suggested potentially good fit between digital pen functionality and consumer note taking needs However, when we explored real world behavior in note taking \(Research Series 1, 3, and 4 above found many potential barriers to adoption of digital pens for note taking. In particular, traditional pen and paper offer advantages in terms of cost, widespread and ad hoc availability, flexibility to work with multiple sources seamlessly, behavioral workflow integration, and manageability of content The value of using digital pens will increase if manufacturers are able to expand their platform technology progressively to enable broader coverage of behavioral scenarios and habits, focusing on the broad range of writing behaviors rather than just needs for facsimile replication on a computer Alternatively, digital pen technology may be more easily applied to tasks involving structured input rather than unstructured note taking We suggest that DP development efforts should use existing linguistic frameworks \(e.g., [2 the space of writing acts of interest.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
