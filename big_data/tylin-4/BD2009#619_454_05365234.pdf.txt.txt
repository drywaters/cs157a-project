Enterprises are increasingly faced with a big challenge of how to integrate the distributed data and applications effectively. The concept of SOA solves the traditional problem of tight coupling and Web Services are the major technology for implementing SOA. However, in recent years, another trend is that REST has increasingly gained much attention and been widely used for Web Services development In this paper, we make an in-depth analysis about traditional Web Services and RESTful Web Services and design a testing scheme to test and analyze the performance of RESTful Web Services to demonstrate that RESTful Web Services are more suitable for Internet-scale distributed data integration Keywords-Web Services; REST; Distributed Data Integration I.  INTRODUCTION Nowadays the enterprises must exchange information frequently on the Web. However, lots of data are located on different enterprise servers. Therefore, enterprise data integration is no longer limited to the interior of enterprises but always beyond the business boundaries. When it comes with integration, we have to face the heterogeneity in platforms, programming languages and data structures and so on Traditional integration technology such as EDI must be built on the VAN and designed in special data formats, while the distributed object-oriented middlewares like CORBA, EJB and DCOM from different vendors are based on proprietary protocol so that they can  t interoperate freely. However, based on the open standards such as XML, SOAP and WSDL, Web Services provide the advantages of loose coupling, seamless interoperability, and good scalability. Additionally, the mature WS-* protocol stack also meets the functional and nonfunctional needs In recent years, after Doctor Roy Fielding puts forward the REST style in his PhD dissertation [1], RESTful Web Services have gained wide social attentions due to its simplicity scalability and performance. Many prominent Internet companies such as Google, Amazon, Yahoo and eBay have publicized their REST APIs. According to the statistics from the most popular Website of APIs and Mashup directory ProgrammableWeb.com, the RESTful Web Services account for 66% of all publicized APIs. It has become a trend to use RESTful services for distributed system development The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the concepts and architecture of traditional Web Services as well as their limitations. Then we analyze the features and advantages of RESTful Web Services in section 3. In the last Section, we design a testing scheme and develop a testing tool to test the performance of RESTful Web Services against traditional Web Services, which aims to demonstrate that RESTful Web Services is a more suitable 


demonstrate that RESTful Web Services is a more suitable solution for Internet-scale distributed data integration II. TRADITIONAL WEB SERVICES A. Concepts and Architecture There are several definitions of Web Service. One of the definitive definitions is given by W3C: A Web Service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-tomachine interaction over a network [2 The foundational infrastructure of Web Services contains three main elements  SOAP is a widely accepted standard messaging protocol that facilitates the exchange of data between network-enabled applications [3  WSDL is a machine-processable format used to describe a service interface [4  UDDI is a platform-independent framework for describing, discovering and publishing services [8 Let  s consider the function of each component by looking over the operations in the specified sequence throughout the life cycle of a Web Service, from creation to consumption see Fig. 1  Figure 1.  Communication process in Web Services 978-1-4244-4507-3/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE  The server uses a SOAP toolkit to create various services  The services are published on the public registry UDDI  A client specifies a search criterion and searches for a desired service on the UDDI registry  The client obtains the service description \(a WSDL document  The client uses the binding information in WSDL to connect to the server  The client constructs a SOAP request to invoke the service located on remote machines through their API In this way, Application's native languages are translated into SOAP protocols through serialization and deserialization to exchange the information between the clients and servers 7], so the Web Services are platform-independent, protocolindependent and decouple the clients and servers B. Limitations 1 operation details and data are encapsulated within the services just exposing only one endpoint of API and all operations use the POST method 2 deserialize native languages into SOAP messages Furthermore, the WS-* protocol stack is also complex so that only programmers can understand how to deploy a service 3 defined for each service, a client must be bound to a specific WSDL. Once the WSDL has changed, the client has to follow these changes 4 WSDL is redundant and meaningless. It increases the network communication volume and server-side payload. And it is difficult to support the proxy and cache servers because clients can not identify the useful information straightforwardly from the URI and HTTP Based on the above analysis, we can find that traditional Web Services abstract much information by encapsulating them inside services rather than on the Web, and they have complex standards and operation process. These limitations may become an obstacle for Internet-scale distributed data integration III. RESTFUL WEB SERVICES A. Concepts REST is a novel architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems when it is put forward. But it becomes popular when it is used as a guideline for designing and 


popular when it is used as a guideline for designing and refining the Web architecture standards. RESTful Web Services are perceived to be simple because REST leverages existing well-know W3C/IETF standards \(HTTP, XML, URI and MIME become pervasive [5 The core principle of RESTful Web Services is resource which is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular point in time [1]. Representations are any useful information about the states of the resources. They are usually a sequence of bytes, plus representation metadata to describe those bytes Resources are identified by the universal standard URIs Components manipulate these resources via a standardized interface HTTP and exchange representations of the resources based on the content negotiation mechanism. So invoking a RESTful Web Service is just like accessing a dynamic Website B. Features and Advantages RESTful Web Services have the following features and advantages 1 a global identifier on the Web rather than require a separate resource discovery and location mechanism such as UDDI 2 each other by using hyperlinks which point to valid future states in representations. What  s most important is that we can implement state transfer by following the links 3 information for the servers to understand it, so each transaction is independent and unrelated to previous ones Servers don  t need to keep states between requests [6 4 fix set of HTTP methods \(GET, PUT, DELETE and POST without special code to deal with each one. Additionally these methods \(except POST In a word, relying on the existing Web standards, RESTful Web Services are easy to deploy, publish, find and invoke Resources are exposed obviously and dynamically computed on the Web. The flexibility and loose coupling these services afford are highly beneficial to both clients and servers [9 IV. PERFORMANCE TEST AND ANALYSIS In this section, we will design a testing scheme and develop a testing tool to test the server performance of RESTful Web Services against traditional Web Services quantitatively in the distributed systems in order to show that the RESTful Web Services have presented higher performance A. Testing scheme Currently, vendors provide many tools and IDEs to facilitate the traditional Web Services development. The most popular technologies are .NET Framework and XFire Java Web Services engine. New frameworks for simplifying RESTful design are also springing up, and ROR \(Ruby on Rails support for agile Web development.  So, in this test, we will use these technologies to build three Web Services, including two traditional Web Services and a RESTful Web Service Additionally, we use multi-threads programming to simulate multi-users to concurrently access the servers in instantaneous time, which means that we use a random function to assign different ISBN numbers for each thread to send the requests at the same time. In this way, we can change the visiting scale easily by increasing and decreasing the numbers of threads Generally speaking, the performance of a server is reflected in two aspects: user-perceived performance and network performance. The former is primary measured by latency while the latter is by payload. So in this test we select two testing indices  The average response time of the server 


 The average response time of the server  The size of the response packet The average response time is the difference between the system time when each thread sends a request and receives the response. The size of the packets is extracted from the Content-Length header in response packets from these services B. Testing tool In order to make the testing results as accurate as possible we use Borland Delphi 7 to develop the testing tool which can set testing parameters like the service API endpoint, the numbers of thread and the searching range before sending the requests. Then the tool will return the average response time of the servers corresponding to what we input C. Test deployment and implementation In this test, we choose MySQL Server 4.1 as the database server and create a database named booksearch, which contains a table with the fields of ID, ISBN, Title, Description and Author to store the book information. \(In order to mitigate the impact of cross-platform and size difference of the response book information messages, all the records are similar in the book table and all the services are developed on Windows XP operating system One traditional Web Service is developed using Microsoft Visual Studio.Net 2003 on IIS5.1 in C#, while the other using MyEclipse on Apache Tomcat 5.0 in JAVA1.6. RESTful Web Service is implemented on Rails2.2 in Ruby using the IDE of RadRails. These three Web Services process the same business logic and share the same data source The function of each Web Service is as follows: the clients send a request containing a parameter value of book ISBN" to invoke a service, and then the servers make a search in their databases to find the book record which match the parameter value and return all of the corresponding book information, including the values of ID, ISBN, Title, Author and Description D. Testing results 1 Traditional Web Services only rely on complex SOAP message to exchange data, while the RESTful Web Services have flexible options. In this test, we choose JSON as the data format in RESTful Web Service  TABLE I.  THE SIZE OF RESPONSE PACKETS \(BIT  ASP.Net Web Service\(XML JAVA Web Service\(XML RESTful Web Service\(JSON Record Size 71 71 71 Response Packet Size 543 418 149 Effective Ratio 13.08% 29.68% 47.65  The results are presented in Table I The first and second rows list the sizes of the book information record \(effective data three Web Services respectively. The effective ratio in row three is the rate between the record size and response packet size. It shows that the JSON response packet in RESTful Web service is about one third of the size of SOAP message packet When obtaining the same size of effective response data, the effective ratio of RESTful Web service is the highest 2 Table II lists the values of average response time of the three servers when they are accessed concurrently under different scales. The first column shows the products of thread numbers and access numbers per thread \(Using more than two access numbers per thread is to avoid that the threads

The average response time of server From the above table and curve graph, we can get The average response time of RESTful Web Service lags behind when the visiting scale is not large, but as the numbers of access are increasing, the curve of RESTful Web Service keeps a very steady upward trend and leads other two traditional Web Services. We can foresee that with the further increase of visiting scale, the performance of the server of RESTful Web Service will be much better than the others according to the average response time finally 3 By analyzing the testing results, we can identify the following reasons  The code of ASP.NET Web service and RESTful Web Service must be re-interpreted before implementing, while .class document of Java can be implemented directly. So JAVA Web Service leads the other two when the visiting scale is within a certain range  The server IIS used in ASP.NET Web Service can be seamlessly integrated to Windows XP operating system, so when the communication volume is low the server performance may be temporarily better than RESTful Web Service However, taking the testing results as a whole, we can see that the performance of RESTful Web Service server is optimal when it is accessed concurrently under  large scale We suggest that the high performance and stability of RESTful Web services are due to the following factors a from their representations so that their contents can be accessed in a variety of formats [5]. Selecting lightweight message formats can reduce the server payload. When the network communication volume comes to a high level, the server performance is still more stable b Services must take more complex steps of finding, binding services before invoking, while RESTful Web Service can be invoked directly. Fewer steps results in lower communication volume. And there are no time-consuming processes such as serializing and deserializing SOAP messages c servers in parallel and does not require any coordination between them, so it is convenient to improve the overall efficiency of server clusters by introducing load balancing mechanisms and drop off the incidence of local errors sharply 


d URI and HTTP headers, RESTful Web Service can be easily supported by conditional GET, data compression and caching mechanisms [6]. All of these features avoid the cost of sending duplicate data and will greatly enhance the performance of the server To sum up, RESTful Web services have more leeway to optimize the performance. When the servers of RESTful Web services are accessed under large scale and concurrently in the distributed systems on Internet, they have high performance and stability V. CONCLUSION RESTful Web Services have the advantages of simplicity unified interface, flexibility, scalability and high performance It is convenient to support independent deployment of components, reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. These advantages are suitable for solving the problems of Internet-scale distributed data integration. Traditional Web Services have more mature extension standards of WS-* protocol stack and good support of development tools to meet the needs of QoS and complex heterogeneous hardware and software system environment. So it is more suitable for enterprise computing. But we believe that both kinds of Web Services have complementary strengths and they will coexist for some time ACKNOWLEDGMENT The works of this paper is supported by MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Science in Chinese Universities \(NO: 07JJD870220 other project team members for their ideas and help in completing this paper REFERENCES 1] Roy Fielding  Architectural styles and the design of network-based software architectures  in university of California. 2000 . in press 2] Xuan Shi  Sharing Service Semantics using SOAP-Based and REST Web Services  IT  PRO .

IT reduction costs and, consequently, on operating expenses of the company. Even though, it was not possible to verify statistically these benefits. We could speculate especially because the p-value decreased from 0.627 to 0.161 that a longer period analysis reveals a statistically significant gain at the 5% level not verified in the analyzed period \(only 2 years  Table 4.

Operating expenses include dayto-day expenses such as sales and administration; thus when a company adopts mechanisms to reduce IT costs, reuse or standardize the IT infrastructure, the operating expenses will be affected, improving this measure. As the same as OM, it was not possible to verify statistically these benefits on the analyzed period Generally speaking, the results regarding to productivity measures did not indicate statistically difference between firms which have adopted IT governance mechanisms and the other group of companies, except for AT which was significant in the year following adoption \(year 1\pparently, firms which have adopted IT governance mechanisms did not improve their relative performance regarding to operating profits and the relation between expenses and revenues. However, analyzing the p-value for both measures \(OM and OS\we note as IT governance mechanisms get more mature, more significant are the differences between IT governance adopters and non-IT governance adopters. This can suggest that productivity benefits will be seen afterwards. Although this study has tried to consider simultaneously both an immediate effect and lagged effects, the short period of analysis could have done the real effects of IT governance adoption miss Regarding to market measures \(SG and SR\we did not identify statistical difference between IT governance adopters and the control group at 5 level \(table 5\en though sales growth \(SG\ has diminished for IT governance adopters in a small proportion than non-IT governance adopters, we could not assert statistically \(p = 0.213 and p = 0.516\at IT governance mechanisms improve sales potential.

Market Measures Comparisons  Therefore, we could verify that firms which have adopted IT governance mechanisms have gotten significant efficiency gains using better their IT resources, or controlling better their IT investments However, the adoption of these mechanisms did not bring market gains to those companies. Maybe a more effective communication of IT governance benefits could make market perceive the firms efforts to improve their IT management and, consequently, their organizational performance  5. Final Remarks  This research investigated the relationship between IT governance mechanisms adoption and firm financial performance. We followed the event-study methodology comparing the performance of a group of firms which have adopted IT governance mechanisms with the performance of a comparable group of firms that did not undergo this adoption Our analysis indicated that IT governance adopters improved sensitively their organizational performance when compared to the control group, mainly regarding about profitability measures \(such as ROA, ROE and profit margin\hat is interesting comment that the effect of IT governance mechanisms on ROE varied over time, being statistically significant solely one year after the IT governance adoption We also found that IT governance mechanisms have been used essentially in the interest of firms  efficiencies, such as cost reduction or better IT infrastructure utilization, in opposite to the expansion benefits such as sales growth and stock prices. These findings corroborate recent studies  2  21  that also found a significant positive relationship or effects between IT investments and these profitability measures In fact, some studies reveal that Brazilian executives still perceive the main benefits of IT related to operating processes than strategic ones when compared to executives from other countries Another aspect of this study was that we measured a lagged effect, the lack of which some researchers identified as one of the main limitations of studies analyzing IT investment impact [12    8    Hu and Plan a v e s t ressed th e n e ed  to observe benefits from IT investments or use over longer time, especially because some IT investments will have short-time effects and others will have longer-term impacts h is res earch tried to consider simultaneously both immediate effect and lagged effects regarding to IT governance mechanisms adoption on financial performance We noted that the impact of these mechanisms potentialize over time, that is, as IT governance mechanisms get more mature, more expressive are their benefits. Therefore, we can say that the impact of those mechanisms is not an isolated event, but a continuous phenomenon being the lag effects larger than the immediate ones This research provides some implications for IS managers and academics. The article proposes the utilization of the event-study method to evaluate the marginal effect of an event on financial performance This method, commonly used in Accounting and Finance studies, was showed possible to be applied in IS studies as well. Its utilization permitted to evaluate a lagged IT effect, identified as one of the main limitations on studies assessing the IT impacts on organizational performan   This study has some limitations. First, we considered only a two-year period of analysis, which could be a short period of time to identify the real benefits of IT governance mechanisms adoption However, as seen on this study, Brazilian companies have gotten involved with IT governance mechanisms very recently. Another limitation applies to the sample used in the study.

post-IT governance mechanisms adoption performance, any firm which had no available data was eliminated from the analysis. This limitation is essentially a factual limitation, not compromising the statistical tests reliability Another limitation of this research is that IT governance adoption was considered a binary variable thereby not distinguishing between different degrees to which IT governance mechanisms were adopted, not allowing to capture this distinction We hope that these contributions prove useful for both scholars and executives striving to understand the benefits of implementing IT governance mechanisms  6.

                                Box 3.1. Basics of Survival Analysis  A comprehensive discussion of this topic in the context of PHM can be found in Ma and Krings \(2008a Survival analysis, also known as failure time analysis, has become a de facto standard for analyzing time-to-event data in biomedical research in the last two decades Survival analysis studies positive random variables for describing times to events in concern, also known as survival time, failure time, or simply time-to-event  Survivor Function and Hazard Function  Survivor function and hazard function are two of the most fundamental definitions in survival analysis. The survivor function S\(t time \(T is lt;&lt;?= ttTPtS 0   Note that S\(t function R\(t instantaneous rate of failure at T=t, conditional upon survival to time t.  It is defined as      lim  0 tS tf t tTttTtPt t  lt The above definitions are for univariate survival analysis; survival analysis has been extended to multivariate systems, or the multivariate survival analysis Hougaard 2000, Ma and Krings 2008c 3.7 and 3.8 for Multivariate Survival Analysis  Fundamental Model of Survival Analysis

It is a semi-parametric model that correlates conditional survivor \(hazard vector \(z  Hazard Function ?\(t, z covariate vector z zetzt  0 where ?0 \(t function for continuous failure time T  Conditional Survival Functions \(on z   0   ztSztS where  t duutS 0 00 exp is the baseline survivor function  There are numerous extensions to Cox's model \(e.g Therneau and Grambsch 2000, Martinussen &amp; Scheike 2006 8                             UUUR, survival analysis, competing risks analysis, and multivariate survival analysis can be utilized to assess the effects of UUUR events. This forms the foundation of tactical level modeling in the three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008  3.2. Competing Risks Analysis  Competing risks analysis \(Box 3.2; Ma &amp; Krings 2008b for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability subject of survival analysis. It has a history dating back to 1760 when Daniel Bernoulli studied the risks around the smallpox inoculation. However, modern competing risks analysis draw extensively on survival analysis, which was only initiated in late 1950s but the active research was not conducted until the1970s The application of competing risks analysis in reliability is quite earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 


earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 1967 controversies around the issues of identifiability, which shadows its value when multiple latent risks are dependent.  Three excellent monographs exist for competing risks analysis \(David &amp Moeschberger 1978, Crowder 2001, Pintilie 2006 perspective of survivability analysis, competing risks analysis can be used for analyzing the effects of unpredictable risks by treating the unpredictable events as censored or the effects of latent risks We use the term latent risks to refer to potential failure risks \(but only one of the risks ultimately causes the system failure survivability analysis; this usage of latent risks is totally consistent with the concept of latent risks in competing risks analysis, where these risks are modeled precisely  3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis                                                      Cont' Box 3.1  Another model that is of nearly comparable status with Cox model is the Accelerated Failure Time model

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
