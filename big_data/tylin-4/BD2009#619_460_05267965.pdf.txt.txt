Decision problems to be solved are often very complicated and require more powerful and often intelligent support tools. Sometimes, it is useful to build an expertise set in some decision steps. Such situation can be met when operating on very large databases and on solving complicated problems However evolving a convenient intelligent components with visualization aspects in IDSS are big challenges to be developed but it would provide a muzzy decision taker an insight preference, and much capability during a decision choice. This paper opt the advanced information visualization schemes for both decision's fact discovery and supporting decision taking processes. It proposes a visualized toolbox for IDSS that integrates DSS and dynamic information visualization within enterprise functionality. Finally this work formulates a viability of implementing such toolbox and presents conclusions Keywords: IDSS, Interactive information Visualization IIV Information Visual Gauge IVG, Muzzy Decision Maker MDM Visual Decision Toolbox VDT I. INTRODUCTION While the human brain can process a limited amount of information, it instantly can recognize hundreds of different visual objects; hence visualization is an important process by which numerical data can be converted to meaningful images.  This conversion   can be computationally done Information visualization \(IV area that has received an increased attentions in developing techniques for exploring databases, attempting to extract a relevant hidden relationships among variables or among causes and effects [6]. The emerging results from IV community can be an important contribution to IDSS community if it can provide novel techniques enable IDSS to utilize a wide range of available information in databases Unfortunately information visualization is still facing several serious challenges During this research, several information visualization works are examined [9 10 and 21]. There are many research efforts have focused on how to transform business process data to shapes whereas decision makers face the challenge of understanding what underlying finding and how they can draw sensible conclusions. Thus a visualized interface should support and improve the entire problem-solving phases, not only data transformation. Most of existing decision support systems, and simulation systems, have built-in functionalities but cannot expose spot environment changing or provide possibilities for negotiation Many of Intelligent Decision Support Systems \(IDSS such as Expert Systems \(ES Systems \(GDSS OLAP and Business Intelligence \(BI 


and Business Intelligence \(BI information visualization techniques. These techniques are more interested in investigating a problem through the use of the static Graphical User Interface GUI manner [1 without considering the visual presentation of information effectively as a steering-set of a decision maker on the front Static graphs of visualized information would have less affect on a decision maker interaction Information overloads burden, with an increasing pressure to perform tasks more quickly and in better manner create a muzzy decision taker. Accordingly interactive visualized information is being worth during decision making activities subject to other limitations in time and cost. Hence, one may address 2D Interactive Information Visualization IIV for this concern. Compared to using traditional data representations such as two-dimensional data set, a decision maker who uses visualizations should perform better during the entire problem-solving process. In fact, this must be the ultimate goal of developing visualizations for better decision-making [20]. A user  s satisfaction with the decision outcomes is a very important factor in predicting preference and attitude for different decision support systems Information visualization \(IV relies on the human  s perception and cognitive abilities to visualize data [11]. Incorporating IV techniques to a decision support system is the potential solution to improve system  s effectiveness and to provide decision makers with better insights about the data that they are analyzing. In the human-computer-interaction \(HCI existed differences among individual are always emphasized whereas a decision-style, which is recognized as one of the key individual cognitive differences that affects system success, has received a little attention in these areas Decision style reflects the way by which a person thinks and reacts with facts about specific situation. In decision support system \(DSS acknowledged to affect decision making performance and one  s preferences for human machine-interface [10][4 Unfortunately, it has been frequently overlooked and rarely been given priority in the DSS design [2] [6 115 This research tackles some of these limitations and trying to overcome such DSS shortcomings. Architecting an Intelligent Visualized Decision Toolbox IVDT. IVDT is the most concern of this research. It mainly originates from focusing on user-specific needs. Therefore, the first aspect of the toolbox is the provision of visualizations in a well understandable way for muzzy decision maker This paper is approaching options to explorative analysis; its focusing is to advance interactive graph visualizing rather than upon looking at a hard graph generated from the answered queries. Such a featured IVDT issues to be proper to adaptability and applicability for a wide range of problems, and may be customized for many business as a workable version The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses visualized elements issues in a related work Section III discusses how this research tackle IVDT problem. Section IV briefly describes the proposed toolbox and presents IVTD prototype. Section V concludes the paper II. VISUALIZED ELEMENTS : RELATED WORK REVIEW There are numerous visualization software tools that are being developed and enhanced gradually for data preparation, data visualization, and data mining. The graphical and fact finding capabilities of software tools vary from package to package, as demonstrated in this limited investigated domain, four core packages e.g. Microsoft MS nature since the data is a read once give a hard displays 


nature since the data is a read once give a hard displays For instance, MS Excel toolbox includes core data visualization types such as column, bar, pie, line, scatter and radar graphs. These traditional graphs are common to most visualization tool suites. MS Excel chart, as shown in figure 1, is used in exploratory data analysis to illustrate the major features of the distribution of the data in a convenient form [8]. However, spotting trends and predicting outcomes by looking at static bar charts or line charts is not always effective due to the limited amount of information that can be displayed, this is particularly true when patterns exist in more than a few dimensions                  Figure 1 visualized elements in ready made package  The user cannot easily interact with the visualization Interactive visualizations IV should allow users to get free hand to amend a visualized displays as similar as displayed data III. IVDT PROBLEM Although the evolution in information visualization is presenting many technological challenges, but the greatest challenge may be retaining an intimate involvement and understanding by end-users. This challenge is a great issue since IV enables decision makers to fast  analyze large quantities of information \(hundreds of entities understanding of data distributions and rapid detection of patterns. IVDT would help users make quicker and betterinforming decision by spotting on business issues and opportunities in a short time and in understandable manner Both information Overload \(IO of inarticulable decision processes that cannot be repeated are driving reasons of IVDT problem Information visualization provides powerful trend to communicate and navigate through outcomes from intelligent visualization processes. There are three important roles for information visualization in the IDSS [20 1- Mission identification i.e. discovering a problem or finding out an opportunity and at which data domain 2- Offering decision making backend services 3- Interactively managing visual outcomes on iterative modes This IVDT work is an extension to the IV-IDSS [20], in order to enable decision makers to: \(a performance, \(b c apply what-if scenarios to understand potential performance in a busy mode conditions IV.

CONCLUSION In this research an Intelligent Visualized Decision Toolbox \(IVDT IVDT requirements assessment is based on both JAD methodology and focused group to answer what is really decision involvers need. The acquired information help very must in architecting IVDT prototype. The introduced IVDT is reviewed and highly accepted. IVDT implementation would greatly exploit the new capabilities in object oriented programming rather than click-and-drop static graphs, it is very easily extendable, and can be basically integrated by extending the tools menu of the main window. IVDT may cope with the progression in both: users' cognitive needs and the modern visualization computing power. It considers a continuous beak time of decision makers by   incorporating inference logic along with associate option-base visualization and can interactivity enhance a decision process. However this research is a direct responsiveness to decision making style and user satisfaction, it is a step forward to improve IVDT effectiveness implementation and popularity REFERENCES 1] Efraim Turban,  Jay E.

 10    The above contour shows static pressure distribution across the model. It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
