Anonymous authentication technology is a solution of this problem. It can protect the personal information and guarantees the convenience which an internet gives in our life. Anonymous authentication is an authentication method based on a digital signature scheme offering anonymity such as blind signature group signature, ring signature, traceable signature etc.  The digital signature scheme that providing anonymity had been being mainly studied for an application including an e-cash and electronic voting system, etc. But recently the digital signature method is studied in the internet environment with one of the anonymous authentication method for the protecting personal information. In this paper, we introduce a group signature scheme which is one of the signature schemes supplying anonymity and propose the anonymous authentication system structure using the group signature scheme  1. Introduction  As an internet is activated, there are many good effects of the internet utilization but the inverse functions are found. The exposure of the unnecessary personal information can be considered as the representative inverse function. It is the big problem that so many people can see the information if personal information is disclosed by mistake of its collector such as internet service provider. And privacy in everyday life is not new. When you buy something at the grocery, no one is going to ask you for some form of ID, and when you send a snail-mail letter, the Post Office doesn  t check if the return address is valid. And who wouldn  t check if the return address is valid. And who wouldn  t be very upset if they found out that the mailman had been reading their mail[8]? The recognition about its own protecting personal information is expanded. And furthermore the demand about the privacy protection and protecting personal information is more enhanced. Users have paid special attention to the problem caused by the fact that many of the operations and transactions they carry out through the Internet can be easily recorded and collected. Thus anonymity has become a desirable feature to be added in many cases[7 In this paper, we propose the anonymous authentication system structure which provides minimal exposure of the personal information. And you can use the most part of the existing Internet services through our anonymous authentication method. In section 2 of this paper, explain the concept of a group signature which is used our anonymous authentication structure In section 3, we simply describe the group signature method of the D. Boneh[6]. In section 4, we propose an anonymous authentication system using group 


anonymous authentication system using group signature of D. Boneh. Finally, in section 5, we present our conclusion  2. Group signature scheme  A group signature scheme is a method for allowing a member of a group to anonymously sign a message on behalf of the group. That is, the verifier knows the signer is a member of the group, but he doesn  t know the identity of the signer. So it can supply anonymity The concept was first introduced by David Chaum and Eugene van Heyst in 1991[1]. According to [1], the group signature has to have the following three characteristics 1 2 signature, but cannot discover which group member made it International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems 978-0-7695-3575-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CISIS.2009.196 1235 3  opened  so that the person who signed the message is revealed In the group signature scheme, group manager has the maximum power; adds group members and reveals the identity of the group member in a special case. The various group signature methods are proposed However, the most group signature scheme follows the following basic procedures 1 group public key and secret keys of each group members with some security parameters 2 user who wants to be a member of the group The user receives the membership certificate and membership secret key from the group manager 3 behalf of the group 4 using group public key 5 signer using group secret key and signature by group manager Also, in recent some papers about group signature scheme  Revocation  process is added  Revocation   process revokes a user  s signing capabilities, without affecting other group members. Many revocation methods are proposed now[5 1 a new signature verification key and giving each signer, except user i, a new signing key This requires an individual secret message to each signer and a public broadcast message to all verifiers 2 short public broadcast message to all signers and verifiers[2 Revocation messages are only sent to signature verifiers, so that there is no need ever to communicate with an end-user machine[3,4,5 The security properties of group signature scheme are correctness, unforgeability, anonymity unlinkability, exculpability, etc. Correctness unforgeability and anonymity are the basic security properties of group signature. On the other hand unlinkability and exculpability are not the necessary security properties but the security properties which 


security properties but the security properties which provide more strong anonymous authentication. The meaning of each security is as follows 1 members always verify correctly, and invalid signatures always fail verification 2 create valid group signatures 3 the identity of the signer cannot be determined without the group manager  s secret key 4 signatures, we cannot tell if the signatures were from the same signer or not 5 and group manager collude, they cannot forge a signature for a non-participating group member  3. Short group signatures [6  In most of group signature scheme, the length of a group signature increases in proportion to the number of group members. But D. Boneh proposed a fixed length of group signature scheme \(independent of the number of group members  called as short group signature because its length of the signature. The length is 1533 bits and it is similar with the length of the RSA signature. Moreover, D. Boneh proposed the method for revoking group members at his paper Short Group Signature is based on the q-strong Diffie-Hellmann\(SDH bilinear map and uses linear encryption method. Qstrong Diffie-Hellmann problem in \(G1, G2 as follows: given a \(q+2  as input, ask to find a pair \( , x G1 and G2 be cyclic groups of prime order p, g1 is a generator of G1 and g2 is a generator of G2. And this problem is known as hard to solve Short Group Signature of D. Boneh consists of five procedures : KeyGen, Sign, Verify, Open, Revoke  KeyGen\(n gpk keys of each group members for n members\(gsk private key of group manager\(gmsk 1 2  from ?p*, where \(?1, ?2 group manager, gmsk 2 3 Set w ? g2 4 i ? n , an SDH tuple \(Ai, xi from ?p*, and set Ai Set each group member  s private key gsk[i Ai, xi 1236 5 g1, g2, h, u, v, w  Sign\(gpk, gsk[i], M T1, T2 T3, c, s?, s?, sx, s?1, s?2 g1, g2, h, u, v, w  Ai, xi 1 compute linear encryption for Ai T1 ? u T2 ? v T3 ?

Each unrevoked group members update their private key and group public key through RL. And revoked group members cannot construct their new private key and group public key, so they cannot generate valid signature  Figure 1 shows the concept of Short Group Signature   Fig. 1. The Concept of SGS  Short Group Signature of D. Boneh supplies some security features: honestly-generated signatures verify and trace correctly\(correctness reveal their signer  s identity\(full-anonymity signatures, even those created by the collusion of multiple users and the group manager, trace to a member of the forging coalition\(full-traceability We can implement anonymous authentication system by applying these features. That is, a signature is signed by a member of the group, but the identity of the signer is not revealed. Anonymous authentication 1237 requires to know not the identity of a user but the truth that user is a qualified honest person. So we think the SGS can be applied to anonymous authentication 


SGS can be applied to anonymous authentication system. By applying the SGS in anonymous authentication, our anonymous authentication system provides tracing feature in case of the signer  s wrong actions  4. Anonymous authentication system  In this chapter, we try to describe about the anonymous authentication system using SGS of the D Boneh which we describe in chapter 3 Our proposed authentication system consists of following processes Verifying the user  s identity Issuing a group member secret key to the identified user Signing a message with his member secret key Authenticate the user with the signed message Supply some services to the authenticated user  In figure 2, these processes are briefly shown   Fig. 2. Construction of anonymous authentication system  Proposed anonymous authentication scheme using short group signature of D. Boneh[6] is as follows 1  s identity. And then it issues a certificate \(it called as real-name certificate X.509 certificate Also, it can issue other kind of certificates such as age certificate, address certificate, sex certificate, etc. if the user requests them 2 Ai Xi Key Issuer verifies the real-name certificate and other certificates of the user if it is needed 3 member, Key Issuer generates a group member secret key pair \(Ai, Xi 4 Ai, Xi 5 provided by SP1, he signs on a message M1 login_request\(SP1 And then he sends his signature value on M1 1 to the service provider SP1 7 using proof of knowledge 8 And this service needs age certificate 9  s age certificate 10 his age certificate   issued by CA And then he sends his signature value on M2 2 to t he SP1 11 using proof of knowledge  Although using internet service through anonymous authentication, Key Issuer generates and issues user  s secret key after verifying user  s identity to trace the user  s identity at a special case. There are various verification method of user  s identity : using certificate verification based on PKI, and seeing the user. If key issuer authenticates a user  s identity, key issuer stores the relationship between the user  s identity and the user  s secret key at secure database. And key issuer 


user  s secret key at secure database. And key issuer sends the user  s secret key pair \(Ai, Xi user sign on a message M using his secret key and group public key, and then send the signature value and message M to a service provider SP1. SP1 verifies the signature value. If it is valid signature, then SP1 serves some service to the user Short group signature proposed by Dan Boneh doesn  t supply linkability that is, it supply unlinkability But most service providers want linkability feature by reason of marketing. Linkability is the antonym of unlinkability. So, in a linkable system, given two messages and their signatures, we can tell if the signatures were from the same signer or not So, for linkability, we propose that user signs on the message  login_request\(SP1  and sends the signature value to the SP1 at every login time. SP1 considers the signature value as an ID and can continuously provide customized service to the user. By our proposed log-in method, user can get privacy protection because the user doesn  t expose his identity to the SP1, and get 1238 convenience because he doesn  t need to remember his ID at the SP1. Also, service provider servers can reduce the cost for protecting its subscribers  personal information, know a propensity of its subscribers, and use this information for marketing like real name authentication. But service provider stores long user  s ID \(1053 bits size, it is the length of SGS has different secret key, so the signature value\(that is log-in ID for the same log-in message  login_request\(the name of service provider   To get the same signature value for the same message by the same user, the values ?, ?,  s?, s?, sx, s?1, s?2  in the SGS must be fixed value not random value. If these values are fixed, the security of Short Group Signature becomes weak. But we think that minimal security can be guaranteed if these values are periodically updated The biggest problem of our proposed method is replay attack. Our solution about this problem is as follows 1  login_request\(SP1   2 provider SP1 3 4 signature value to SP1 5  This solution has a problem.  If another user\(attacker tries replay attack and signs on a challenge, the verification process of service provider on the signature value will be true. It remains as future work. But, if some problem occurs by the attacker, service provider performs  open  protocol of Short Group Signature and can find identity of the attacker by the signature value on a challenge If there is an additional information to know during anonymous authentication service, service provider can request additional information\(for example, age, sex address of a user sex certification, or address certification issued by trusted 3rd party to the service provider. Service provider verifies the certificate\(s requested service to the user if the verification of the certificate\(s  5. Conclusion  


 Internet service provides us convenience and prosperity but has bad effects. It may be transient phenomenon an internet shows up in our life in the process of settling down. However, if the effort to resolve the dysfunction is added, an internet service can give us more benefits. A typical dysfunction of internet service is indiscreet collection of personal information of internet users and exposure of the collected information. And anonymous authentication method can be one of the solutions. Anonymous authentication method has some merits; the collection of the users  persona information by service providers doesn  t need and the exposure possibility of the collected information by administrator of the information is very low In this paper, we proposed the anonymous authentication system structure based on group signature method among various signature methods supplying anonymity. According to our proposed anonymous authentication system, internet users don  t have to supply their all personal information to service providers and service providers can reduce the expenses required for the users  personal information management and use the propensity of users for marketing by our login method through the same ID per user Moreover, if additional information about a user is needed when a user is offered the specific service, by submitting the certificate issued from the trusted 3rd party to the service provider a service can be received If a user does illegal action or damages a person, the user is traced through his signature and his identity is revealed  6.

Karen does not need to specify these activities in any more detail. With seven year tenure on the ward she knows the nurses work rhythm by heart. There is no need to specify Anna s medical history, nor the times she requires oxygen or nebulizer treatments Karen relies on a non-verbal understanding and simply uses her notes as a scaffold to support her unfolding practices. The doctors use their brain notes in a similar fashion. Referring to his brain notes an ER intern explains No one else is going to understand what this means. This is very specific to what I do. Most people just jot notes to themselves -- you know: '5 year old, nasal foreign body, 10 days out of 21 days thick discharge, yellow green, treat with XYZ contact primary.' There is no time line in it; there is no thought process. I know what this means because I am here. But no one else will be able to make sense of it   A n n a  H a u g e  8 4 6 R 8 2  M o s 5  6  k g B r o n c h o b s t r u c t i o n s O 2  n e b s  Q 2 N o  s u r g e r y  c o n s u l t  t o d a y S o c i a l   m o t h e r  t o d a y  Figure 4. Karen s brain notes As indicated by the intern these private notes only work for their author. By the end of a shift the intern will update the resident note and add clues which will orient his fellow interns. Still these remain rather vague and rely heavily on the interns shared knowledge of the patients and the rhythm of work on the ward. In Karen s case, she adds context clues as she edits the management plan. To motivate changes to Anna s diet or personal needs she may add to the concise history field of the management plan. She will only add changes that she deems important to her close community of nurses at 10 East. She writes when the surgery team meeting is scheduled, but she will only summarize her meeting with Anna s mother if information relevant to the nurses comes to light Towards the end of Anna s hospitalization the same process takes place. The resident note system largely consists of a list of patient identifiers and activities. In the process of writing Anna s discharge summary Marc strips away these local coordination tools and adds contextual information by positioning Anna s care on 10 East as the culmination of a narrative starting with her past medical, family history, and diagnosis upon arrival in the hospital The rest of the discharge summary reviews what is considered relevant organ groups for Anna s case or rather relevant sub-specialties involved in her care while at 10 East. In the process of writing the discharge summary Marc adds genre clues broadly accepted in the medical community, involving formatting, and terminology. Senior residents and attending doctors often scold interns for using acronyms and lingo specific to Kiltham Hospital in their discharge summaries. Marc is literally making Anna s history public and portable by turning the resident note list into a narrative with full sentences and specification of authorship. The document cycle is completed Documents oscillate between broader narrower explication  of Participants Times Places Content Format Background knowledge Explicit Documents Br o a d e r N a r ro w e r N a r r o w e r B r o a d e r  Figure 5. Document cycles and their oscillations As summarized in Figure 5, we can depict the two document cycles as a continuous oscillation between a broader and narrower framing of Anna s care. The daily cycles \(small cycles\ embedded in the larger cycle covering Anna s stay at 10 East. These oscillations involve changes to how broadly and narrowly the documents explicate participants, times places, and content. The cyclical integration mitigates the tension between a documents power to explicate its use and the background knowledge people bring to the document. The two triangles in Figure 5 signify the inverse relationship between documents and users. In the top of the cycle we find documents broadly explicating the relevant participants, times places, and content, thus facilitating understanding by people holding little background knowledge. As we move down in the cycle we see a shift towards documents leaning heavily on users intimate knowledge of the work but which offers little guidance to the reader 4  4 Dialog at Beginning & End of Cycles  At the beginning and end of each document cycle one finds interactions involving oral communication The dialogs engage the participants in reflections about their patient s past and future care and stand out as central to the oscillation taking place within each cycle. Doctors and nurses place great emphasis on these meetings. When two interns were asked Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 
 


what time of day they considered the most important they answered in unison Sign-out Here, the doctors update their respective resident and senior notes. Each intern and senior resident will report on their patients to their on-call colleague, the doctor staying in the hospital over night. Their conversations focus on the patients that need the most attention during the night, difficult orders and other urgent tasks. It is a time to recount the work done in the course of the day and establish an itinerary for the night. Likewise, the other meetings engage the participants in dialog about individual cases and/or how to manage all patients under their collective care  Tensions tend to escalate when a document cycle does not start or end with a reflective encounter Interns quarrel locally about the content of their resident notes during sign-out and attending doctors scold residents during rounds; but it is nothing compared to the anger doctors and nurses express when receiving a document from another setting countering their expectations and with no chance to clarify the problem Primary care doctors regularly complain that the discharge summaries that they receive from other health care settings lack information significant to them. One primary care doctor, Frida, with 18 years tenure grumbled one afternoon about a discharge summary, she had received that afternoon from a surgeon who had set her patient s leg after a skiing accident a few days earlier. The teenager, Jacob showed up in her clinic with a swollen leg and a rash After examining Jacob, Frida explained to the ethnographer This is a crappy note [from the surgeon It s no help to me. He [the surgeon does n o t ev en tell m e  what antibiotic he gave Jacob [post operation an d how much. I have no way of telling whether the rash he presents with today is related to the antibiotics  Frida calls the surgeon s office to clarify the issue. The surgeon has left his clinic at 3:00pm. His discharge summary does not provide her enough information to help her diagnose the problem. A flow sheet filled out during the surgery most likely contains the information Frida needs. However, in the discharge papers the surgeon summarized his setting of the leg but does not describe the administration of antibiotic post surgery that to him is probably an inconsequential routine Dialog and reflective encounters play a central role in each document cycle. The dialog allows a heterogeneous groups of healthcare professionals with different responsibilities and routines to mend the relationship between the background knowledge people bring to Anna s care and the degree to which documents explicate relevant participants, times places, content, and form. Such discussions also allow doctors and nurses to question patients history and their care. By engaging with patients histories people with different perspectives on care can suggest changes to the configuration of participants times, places and data relevant for the patient Document cycles lacking routine reflective encounters often leave little chance for the different constituencies to clarify their position and repair the relations between documents and their users 5. Discussion More than ten years ago Star and Ruhdeler [1  o r a practic ebas e d approach to organizational infrastructure and knowledge flows  one that does not depict system integration as a substrate: something upon which something else runs or operates \(e.g., railway system\. Studying how doctors and nurses integrate documents, whether electronic or paper-based, in the course of their daily work allows us to extend such an approach to system integration We find that doctors and nurses continuously transform documents making them relevant to a particular set of participants, times and places. In doing so they adjust the relationship between how much documents explicate and the background knowledge required from the readers. Two such transformations stand out as central First, doctors and nurses engage in a number of cyclical transformations, within which they oscillate between documents addressing a broader and narrower audiences \(see figure 1 and 2\. In doing so they manage to straddle the demands of local work practices and the needs to coordinate with other teams in other times and places Second, as summarized in figures 1 and 2 one finds a number of transformations between the cyclical organized documents \(e.g., nurse management plans, brain notes, intern notes, senior notes, etc\d documents peripheral to the cycles e.g., lab work, flow sheets, orders, etc.\ and nurses use their document cycles as the clearing station for a host of document systems. The cyclical organized documents allow people to transform data from peripheral documents into something useful for their immediate work practices. At the same time they draw from their cyclical documents to produce other non-cyclical documents. For instance, Marc and other doctors integrate test results from the laboratory Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 
 


system into their brain notes and later the residence note system. Likewise, they write orders and other request information based on their brain notes The existing literature allows us to capture only parts of these cyclical transformations. Latour and Woolgar [1 d Kn orrC e t i n a 22] w o rk des c ri bes the individual transformations well. The concept of communicative genres of f e rs i n s i gh ts to th e  individual documents and how they might be linked into sequentially organized genre systems. Likewise we could conceive of the documents in the present case as boundary objects bridging the relations among different communities  The cyclical patterns reported here, however present an opportunity to integrate these related practice-based research streams. The concept of communicative genres, for instance, supplements descriptions of document transformation in document cycles. Furthermore, the findings suggest the existence of multiple document types playing different roles in knowledge flows. Boundary objects may not stand alone in knowledge sharing across communities. Rather, they seem to interact with a host of other documents. For instance, one could argue that lab results serve as a boundary object for many groups caring for Anne. As a repository each group can draw from and contribute to the lab result system. Yet, this boundary object does not stand alone. Only when we see the lab result system in relation to the use of nurse management plans, brain notes, intern notes and senior notes do we understand the intricate knowledge flow. The boundary object is but on cog in a larger document machinery Reflection and dialog play central parts in the cyclical integration of documents. Confirming findings in the boundary object literature, conflicts are prone to surface when people from different professions, sub-specialties, or local organizational cultures negotiate their often diverging approaches to patient care [3, 4, 32 R e f l ectiv e en co u n t er s allo w  collaborators to recalibrate the reciprocal relationship between documents and organizational members \(i.e document explicates and background knowledge\At the same time these interactions serve as a staging ground for questions that may broaden or narrow the collective work practices. Doctors and nurses may question whether they need more information about the patient s medical history or consider alternative treatment plans. The meetings secure an ongoing reflection on the appropriate course of Anna s care Much like a hermeneutic process, doctors and nurses engage with parts of patients care only to return to a broader picture to interpret the integration of its parts. The movement of their understanding and writing, then, is a constant moving from the whole to its parts and back to the whole [9, 33  Finally, the document cycles offers a window into the institutional structure of the hospital and the temporal and spatial organization of work. We notice how the cycles support departmental divisions and the temporal structure of work in the institution Without these document cycles it would be impossible to maintain the high level of complexity where multiple professions and subdisciplines work together, with somebody present to knowledgably care for Anna 6. Conclusion & Implications The study identifies a cyclical pattern to the knowledge flow in a heterogeneous information systems environment. Drawing on data from the healthcare industry we describe how doctors and nurses organize a host of document systems around a central cyclical pattern involving an oscillation between addressing a broader and narrower configuration of participants, times, places, and content. Numerous documents feed to and from the cyclically organized documents. The constant transformation from one document to the next allows organizational members to manage the reciprocal relationship between how much documents explicate their use and how much background knowledge readers need to bring to the document. This relationship is brittle and despite the many transformations among documents it often breaks down. The research suggests that organizational members build opportunities for dialog into the document cycles in an effort to patch any possible breaks in knowledge sharing The present research is not without limits. It relies on a single in-depth ethnographic study, thereby subjecting it to a set of well-known limitations, most notably restricted empirical generalizability. Despite the limitations, the research has implications for research and practice. First, to fully take advantage of our cyclical notion of documents and integrate the existing practice-based theories require more theoretical and empirical work. For instance, what cyclical patterns do we find beyond the healthcare industry? Second, future research will have to explore how efforts to standardize medical information and facilitate retrieval can coexist with cyclical documenting practices In regard to practice, system design may gain from supporting a host of document types and allow people to transform one document into another document characterized by different configurations of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 
 


participants, times, places, content, and form. Across documents the content may be deceivingly alike. Yet one must keep in mind that each document manages an intricate reciprocal relationship between how much the document explicate and the background knowledge people bring to its use Finally, system designers may distinguish circular integration of documents and documents feeding to and from the cycles. People use their central cycles to manage many other document systems. The cycle allows people to transform data from peripheral documents into something useful for their immediate work practices  7.

  13 Second, differences exist in the programmatic consequences between the loss of an Ares I stack and an Ares V stack beyond the replacement cost. Ares I and Orion flight rates could be relatively high to support ISS and lunar missions Replacing one of these stacks would be a matter of accelerating the next launch vehi cle in the pipeline. For the Ares V and Altair, however the replacement could involve more significant delays. The Ares V itself would be a more expensive and more complex vehicle to replace. The Altair lander presents the greatest complexities. A limited number of landers will be produced for the lunar campaign Acquiring an additional repl acement lander could involve the reopening of production lines. In addition, each Altair will be unique to some degree because of the mission objectives and the cargo that it carries. Finally, the cargo itself would need to be repl aced in the event of a loss Summary Comparison Table 13 summarizes the comparison of the three launch options. In this table, the cells that indicate potential negative aspects for each case are highlighted I-V 4-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter 227The I-V launch order case resulted in the highest PnSL of the three final cases, with a probability of a missed second launch of 5.4 per mission. However, because of the low cost of failure for this case, it also had the lowest expected vehicle replacement cost at 0.05 AI per mission V-I 4-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter 227The V-I option with 4-day EDS and Orion loiter has a PnSL that is similar to that for the I-V option at 4.7%. The PnSL for this case was somewhat lower due to the lower complexity of the second launch vehicle. This case, however, resulted in the greatest expected cost of failure at 0.14 AI. In addition, the V-I launch order includes the additional considerations that involve the pressure to relax flight rules and the difficulty in replacing an Ares V stack V-I 14-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter 227 Of the three options, the V-I 14-day EDS loiter case presented the best PnSL value. The 1.9% PnSL wa s less than half the PnSL for either of the 4-day loiter cas es. However, because of the high cost of failure, the overall expected vehicle replacement cost per mission was similar to that of the I-V 4-day case In evaluating this case, the primary concern, however, was over the other required costs Because of the added boil-off propellant and other described EDS complexities required to support this duration, the baseline 51.0.48 Ares V option was no longer viable. The 51.0.47 Ares V option, with an upgraded capacity, would be required. The DDT&E costs for this upgrade would be large. The cost difference for the Ares V upgrade alone is estimated to be greater than $1B. In addition, the costs to upgrade the EDS, including photovoltaic arrays and MMOD protection, would be added. Although these are one-time DDT&E costs rather than recurring costs, they occu r in a phase of the program where the budget is most restricted In addition, the 51.0.47 design for the Ares V has been reserved as an option in case it is needed because of mass growth or performance uncertainty for the transportation system. If the upgraded design is adopted in the baseline to support a 14-day loiter and a more complex EDS, then no current options are available to provide a hedge against mass growth or performance uncertainty in the transportation system. While further upgrades to the EDS are possible, these upgrades were not considered desirable when the 51.0.48 and 51.0.47 options were down-selected for further consideration by the Constellation Program Because of the requirement to upgrade the Ares V to the 51.0.47 option, as well as the added complexity of the EDS stage, the V-I 14-day loiter case was removed from consideration for the 1\275-launc h launch operational concept While this option offers a significantly lesser PnSL than the other two options at 1.9% ve rsus 4.7% - 5.4%, the added costs and risks associated with this option, particularly costs during the crucial DDT&E period, were determined to be unacceptable. This opinion was reinforced by the results for total expected replacement cost While the V-I 14-day loiter case has a low PnSL, because of the high consequence of failure, the total expected replacement cost was actually somewhat greater than for the I-V 4-day loiter case 10  S ELECTION OF 1 1  2 L AUNCH P OINT OF D EPARTURE O PERATIONAL C ONCEPT  As described previously, the V-I 14-day loiter case was determined by decision makers to involve too much added cost and risk to justify the resultant improvement in PnSL The decision was reinforced by the fact that the second primary metric, the expected cost of failure, was not improved by the V-I case with a longer loiter period The two final cases, the I-V 4-day loiter and the V-I 4-day loiter, were compared; the I-V launch order was selected for the baseline point-of-depar ture architecture The PnSL values, which represent the probability of a failure event during the dual launch phase, were similar for the I-V and V-I cases, at 5.4% and 4.7%, respectively. The expected replacement cost per mission was significantly lower for the I-V case, howev er. Even with the cost uncertainty, the I-V case clearly would likely always result in a lower total cost Crew safety was a major consideration in selecting between the two cases. A clear, quantifia ble added risk to the crew exists in selecting the I-V launch order. The crew would be required to endure an additiona l set of launch, loiter, and EDL events in the case of a missed second launch 


  14 However, because the probab ility of loss of crew is conditional to the PnSL, the overall added risk of 1 in 6,092 is considered to be quite small. This is particularly true when the added risk is compared with the overall risks to the crew that are anticipated for a human lunar mission In addition, although they could not be quantified at this point in time, additional crew risks are associated with the V-I launch order. Although no determination can be made at this point whether these range safety risks may be similar in magnitude to the added risks in the I-V case, they certainly cannot be totally discounted The selected I-V case with a 4-day loiter and 90-minute separation offered the most balanced results across the FOMs that were used in this study. The PnSL of 5.4% was larger than other cases but sim ilar to the PnSL that could be achieved in any case if the Ares V was limited to the 51.0.48 option. The consequence of failure in this case was much less than for the V-I case, which resulted in an expected cost of less than ha lf of that for the V-I launch order In addition, the other complexities that were associated with the V-I launch order\226potential pressure to relax flight rules and the disruptions caused by having to replace an Ares V\226 also trended toward the selection of the I-V launch order 11  P OINT OF D EPARTURE AND U NCERTAINTY  Note that the selected 1\275-launch operational concept represents only a point-of-departu re architecture to be used as a baseline for ongoing lunar architecture studies. It does not represent a final selection of launch order, separation, or loiter period, and NASA is taking no steps to preclude a change in the operational concept in the future In fact, because of the uncerta inty that is involved in the initial design and costing, the possibility exists that, upon further refinement, the parame ters that drive this study could change to a degree that would cause the operational concept to be reconsidered In addition, significant uncertainty exists in the data that were used to generate the Pn SL results in C-RAST. Because the Ares V is still in the early stages of design, large amount of uncertainty still exists as to the launch reliability for the vehicle. As the design matures and more accurate estimates of reliability become available, the operations concept could also be reconsidered In fact, it may ultimately be desirable to develop a 1\275launch system that allows for launch in either order. For the purposes of this study, the Ares V reliability and, therefore the PnSL were treated as consta nt values. Because there is a limited test program for the Ares V before the crewed lunar mission begins, there is liable to be significant growth in reliability for the Ares V over a number of missions. If the initial reliability is low, then the desire would be to launch the Ares V first so that the crew is not launched unnecessarily. Because the values used in this analysis represent the mature steady-stat e estimates, the PnSL for the I-V options could be worse than predicted in this analysis for some number of early missions. If the initial reliability is significantly lower, then it may be desirable to launch initial missions in a V-I order and then switch to I-V as reliability improves To address this uncertainty, an additional set of analyses was completed. In this uncertainty analysis, calculations were made to determine how much each major input parameter would have to change in order to cause the launch option decision to change, if that decision were made on expected replacement cost alone. The analysis was conducted by comparing the final two options: the I-V 4day loiter and the V-I 4-day loiter cases The results of the uncertainty analysis are shown in Table 14. In this table, the current estimate used for each major parameter is listed. Then, the value for each parameter at which the launch order decision \(based on the expected cost of failure\would switch is listed. Generally, the required shifts are large, although the required changes in Table 14 are for single variables only. Simultaneous changes of multiple parameters that are lower in magnitude could also cause a change in the launch order decision The greatest level of uncertain ty in the current analysis involves the transportation element replacement costs Because of the uncertainty involving fixed and marginal costs for Altair and because of the uncertain nature of cost estimates in early design large shifts could potentially occur in the cost data for all elements as the designs mature Table 14. Sensitivity of Launc h Order Decision to Major Parameters Parameter Current Estimate Value at Which Launch Order Would Switch \(if all other values remain constant PnSL I-V 4-day loiter 5.4% 13.5 PnSL V-I 14-day loiter 4.7% 1.9 Cost of Ares I Stack 1.00 AI 2.5 AI Cost of Ares V Stack 2.88 AI 1.15 AI  


  15 In order to represent the impact of uncertainty in the cost data, a \223breakeven\224 cost ratio was determined. The important factor in compari ng expected costs for the I-V and V-I launch orders is not the absolute costs of the Ares I and Ares V stacks but rather the relative costs between the two. Given the predicted PnSL values for the I-V and V-I cases, any set of cost data in wh ich the cost of the Ares V is greater than 115% of the cost of the Ares I will result in the expected replacement cost pe r mission for the I-V option being lower. This relationship is depicted graphically in Figure 6 Figure 6 can be used to determine the resultant optimal launch order for any set of Ares I and Ares V stack replacement costs, based on mini mizing the expected cost of failure. The cost of the Ares V stack is specified on the horizontal axis, and the cost of the Ares I stack is specified on the vertical axis. The sloping red line in the center of the figure represents the break-even cost boundary. If the set of costs is below this line in the light-blue region, then the I-V launch order is preferable. If the set of costs are above the red line in the light-green region, then the V-I launch order is preferable The intent of Figure 6 is to provide a visual indication of how much change could occur in the cost estimates before the launch order decision would be reconsidered. The current cost estimates are represented as a vertical bar on the chart. The Ares I cost is fixed at 1.00 AI. The Ares V cost is represented as a range of 1.65 to 2.88 AI, which represents the full range that is produced by the possible inclusion of fixed costs Across the range of current co st estimates, a large margin still exists before the break-eve n point is reached. Even with no fixed costs included for the Ares V, the Ares V cost would have to decrease by 32%, or the Ares I cost would have to increase by 47% for the cost of failure to be equal for the two cases. These changes seem to be outside the current range of cost uncertainty The Constellation Program has initiated an action to monitor the key parameters identified in this analysis as the transportation element designs continue to mature. If the designs reach a state at wh ich the selected point-ofdeparture operational concept is called into question, then this baseline may be updated 12  S UMMARY  The initial specification of an operational concept for the 1\275-launch solution was largely based on three assumptions First, there was a \223gut reaction\224 that one would not want to risk launching a crew until the EDS and lander were safely in orbit. Second, the assumption was made that the probability of missing the second launch could be substantially reduced by providing a long loiter period for  Figure 6 \226 Relative Ares I and Ares V Stack Costs 


  16 the EDS. Finally, with long EDS loiter periods, the assumption was made that a 24-hour launch separation would have no significant impact on mission success More detailed analysis indicat ed that all three of these assumptions were not entirely accurate. The added risk to the crew, dictated by the c onditional probability of enduring a second launch and encountering a loss-of-crew event, was quite small, especially as compared with the total risk for a human lunar mission The ability to use added loiter to reduce PnSL was largely limited by the Ares V capabilities. Loiter periods of more than four days would require a change to the selected Ares V option \(significantly increasing DDT&E and unit cost and would substantially increase the complexity of the EDS Finally, with shorter loiter periods, the 24-hour launch separation significantly increased the probability of no second launch. The increase in PnSL outweighed the advantages of having a long separation between the launches Taking these limitations into account, the assumed launch order, launch separation, and lo iter duration were called into question. A structured methodology to evaluate the probability of failure, the cost of failure, and the risk to the crew allowed NASA decision makers to methodically compare the options and to se lect a point-of-departure for 1\275-launch operations that would result in the best expected mission performance Loiter durations of greater than four days were determined to be nonviable. The added cost and complexity of the Ares V and the EDS, particularly during the DDT&E period would impose significant affo rdability issues. Although the PnSL could be substantially reduced by increasing the loiter, these improvements did not justify the added complexity With loiter periods limited to four days or less, the 24-hour launch separation was also determined to be nonviable Although switching to a 90-minute separation would impose some operational complexity at launch and could impose some additional risk to the crew in a V-I launch order, these factors were outweighed by the significant penalty to PnSL Finally, the launch order itself was evaluated. With a 4-day loiter, both launch orders resulted in similar values for PnSL. The I-V order would result in some added crew risk in the event of a missed launch, but the magnitude of the added risk was determined to be quite small, especially because the crew would face some indeterminate added flight hazard risk in the V-I option as well. The major discriminator between launch orders was in the expected cost of failure. Because a 1\275-l aunch failure in the V-I order would result in the loss of an Ares V, the EDS, and the Altair lander, the consequence of failure is quite high. A failure in the I-V launch order would result in substantially lower costs to replace the Ares I and an Orion service module and refurbish an Orion crew module. The result of the large difference in relative co sts is that the expected cost of failure is substantially lower for the I-V launch order The results of the study allowed decision makers to select a I-V launch order, with a 90-minute separation and a 4-day EDS/Orion LEO loiter period as the point-of-departure operational concept. This concept will serve as the baseline for ongoing lunar mission development. However, as designs mature and the major parameters used in this analysis are refined, the operational concept for the 1\275launch solution will be further evaluated R EFERENCES    223Expl orat i on Sy st em s Archi t ect ure St udy   Fi nal  R e port 224  NASA-TM-2005-214062, November 2005. url http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/news/E SAS_report.html   Doug C ooke, \223Lunar Archi t ect ure Updat e\224 Nat i onal  Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2007. url http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/190083main_AIAA_ESMD_fin alSPACE2007.pdf 3 Gran t Cates, W illiam Cirillo an d Ch el Stro m g ren   223Lo w  earth orbit rendezvous strategy for lunar missions,\224 Proceedings of the I EEE 2006 Winter Simulation Conference ed.

The HyspIRI mission utilizes innovative techniques to both reduce the amount of data that must be transmitted to the ground and accommodate the required data volume on the ground The infrastructure and techniques developed by this mission will open the door to future high data volume science missions The designs presented here are the work of the authors and may differ from the current HyspIRI mission baseline A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and was sponsored by the Space Grant program and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration R EFERENCES  K W ar\002eld T  V  Houten C Hee g V  Smith S Mobasser B Cox Y He R Jolly C Baker S Barry K Klassen A Nash M Vick S Kondos M Wallace J Wertz Chen R Cowley W Smythe S Klein L Cin-Young D Morabito M Pugh and R Miyake 223Hyspiri-tir mission study 2007-07 002nal report internal jpl document,\224 TeamX 923 Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology 4800 Oak Grove Drive Pasadena CA 91109 July 2007  R O Green 223Hyspiri summer 2008 o v ervie w  224 2008 Information exchanged during presentation  S Hook 2008 Information e xchanged during meeting discussion July 16th  R O Green 223Measuring the earth wi th imaging spectroscopy,\224 2008  223Moore s la w Made real by intel inno v ation 224 http://www.intel.com/technology/mooreslaw/index.htm  T  Doggett R Greele y  S Chein R Castano and B Cichy 223Autonomous detection of cryospheric change with hyperion on-board earth observing-1,\224 Remote Sensing of Environment  vol 101 pp 447\226462 2006  R Castano D Mazzoni N T ang and T  Dogget 223Learning classi\002ers for science event detection in remote sensing imagery,\224 in Proceedings of the ISAIRAS 2005 Conference  2005  S Shif fman 223Cloud detection from satellite imagery A comparison of expert-generated and autmatically-generated decision trees.\224 ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub/917/0917 Shiffman  M Griggin H Burk e D Mandl and J Miller  223Cloud cover detection algorithm for eo-1 hyperion imagery,\224 Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2003 IGARSS 03 Proceedings 2003 IEEE International  vol 1 pp 86\22689 July 2003  V  V apnik Advances in Kernel Methods Support Vector Learning  MIT Press 1999  C Bur ges 223 A tutorial on support v ector machines for pattern recognition,\224 Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  vol 2 pp 121\226167 1998  M Klemish 223F ast lossless compression of multispectral imagery internal jpl document,\224 October 2007  F  Rizzo 223Lo w-comple xity lossless compression of h yperspectral imagery via linear prediction,\224 p 2 IEEE Signal Processing Letters IEEE 2005  R Roosta 223Nasa jpl Nasa electronic parts and packaging program.\224 http://nepp.nasa.gov/docuploads/3C8F70A32452-4336-B70CDF1C1B08F805/JPL%20RadTolerant%20FPGAs%20for%20Space%20Applications.pdf December 2004  I Xilinx 223Xilinx  Radiation-hardened virtex-4 qpro-v family overview.\224 http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation data sheets/ds653.pdf March 2008  G S F  Center  223Tdrss o v ervie w  224 http://msp.gsfc.nasa.gov/tdrss/oview.html 7  H Hemmati 07 2008 Information e xchanged during meeting about LaserComm  223W orldvie w-1 224 http://www digitalglobe.com/inde x.php 86/WorldView-1 2008  223Sv albard ground station nor way.\224 http://www.aerospacetechnology.com/projects/svalbard 7 2008  223Satellite tracking ground station 224 http://www.asf.alaska.edu/stgs 2008  R Flaherty  223Sn/gn systems o v ervie w  224 tech rep Goddard Space Flight Center NASA 7 2002  223Geoe ye-1 f act sheet 224 http://launch.geoeye.com/launchsite/about/fact sheet.aspx 2008  L-3 Communications/Cincinnati Electronics Space Electronics 7500 Innovation Way Mason OH 45040 T-720 Transmitter  5 2007 PDF Spec Sheet for the T720 Ku-Band TDRSS Transmitter  L-3 Communications/Cincinnati Electronics Space Electronics 7500 Innovation Way Mason OH 45040 T-722 X-Band  7 2007 PDF Spec Sheet for the T-722  J Smith 07 2008 Information e xchanged during meeting about GDS  J Carpena-Nunez L Graham C Hartzell D Racek T Tao and C Taylor 223End-to-end data system design for hyspiri mission.\224 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Education Of\002ce 2008  J Behnk e T  W atts B K obler  D Lo we S F ox and R Meyer 223Eosdis petabyte archives Tenth anniversary,\224 Mass Storage Systems and Technologies 2005 Proceedings 22nd IEEE  13th NASA Goddard Conference on  pp 81\22693 April 2005 19

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
