Barabanov and Dmitry V. Romaev Abstract  A navigation system was designed for an autopilot of a small helicopter. It contains two remote web cameras and an onboard sensor with three gyroscopes and three accelerometers. The camera positions are unknown. The gyroscope and accelerometer measurements have unknown random bias with a slow trend. For estimation of these parameters an adaptive filtering system with the extended Kalman filter is developed Tuning of the filter parameters is made online by minimization of the high frequency part of the helicopter velocity estimate A new method is also developed for smoothing of the big oscillations forced by rotation of the main rotor that appear in the gyroscope measurements of the angular velocity. The method is based on equations from the helicopter motion model that give a relation between linear accelerations and the Euler angles estimated by integration of the angular velocity measurements The state estimation problem for linear plant with measurements under uncertainties is commonly solved by Kalman filter that gives appropriate estimates under wide conditions. The equations of the Kalman filter contain coefficients of the linear dynamic plant and of the measurement equation, and also variances of the plant disturbances and measurement noises. Accuracy of the filter estimate depends significantly from parameters in the filter that stand for that variances. But as a rule the variances are not known and, moreover, they describe both random noises and model errors. Therefore, there is no enough information about these parameters which are important for the estimate accuracy In this paper, we present an adaptive filter with estimation of the ratio between amplitudes of plant disturbance and measurement noise. We assume that the estimated variable is scalar and a scalar measurement of this variable contains noise. This noise is very big and therefore plant model and Kalman filter are used for noise attenuation. The global convergence of the estimation algorithm is proved for special cases. The simplest algorithm converges under additional condition on the stabilizing controller. An auxiliary signal was found that transforms the identification procedure to the globally stable recursion. Finally, explicit analytic expressions are presented for the dependence of the prediction error variance from the parameter in the Kalman filter that stands for the noises ratio The proposed adaptive Kalman filter was implemented for estimation of the angular velocities in the helicopter autopilot. The autopilot system was designed for a small This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Researches under the grant 07-04-00750 Saint Petersburg State University, Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics 198504 Saint Petersburg, Russia Andrey.Barabanov@gmail.com electrical helicopter, and laboratory experiments have shown its efficiency. The flight data were collected from remote Web cameras that are sensors of the autopilot system. At the same time measurements were obtained from onboard gyroscopes They have very big noises in angular velocities forced by the main rotor revolution. These noises were suppressed by adaptive Kalman filter, and the resulting velocities estimates were compared with that obtained from Web cameras I.

ESTIMATION OF ROLL AND PITCH ANGULAR VELOCITIES OF HELICOPTER The adaptive Kalman filter from Theorem 1 was implemented for investigation of data collected from flights of a small electrical helicopter with autopilot system. The full system consists of the following parts: a helicopter Walkera X450 with remote control panel connected to the computer two Web cameras looking at the helicopter and connected to the same computer, and an onboard gyroscope sensor sending measurements to the computer. The closed loop system was designed by camera measurements only because the onboard sensor contains very big noises The helicopter was stabilized in the hanging mode. The open loop system is very unstable, it is disturbed by wind and control have essential delays. For these reasons the steady state position which is called balanced cannot be achieved exactly. The helicopter moves around this position with small amplitude. The angular roll and pitch velocities are shown in Fig. 1. They were obtained from remote Web cameras and are reliable. Measurements from cameras come to the computer asynchronously with the average speed of 30 images per second 1697 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Roll and Pitch angular velocities  x   z time, seconds Fig 1. Roll and pitch velocities The onboard gyroscopes are very sensitive. Their speed is 273 samples per second while the rotation velocity of the main rotor is about 29 revolution per second. Since the forces acting the helicopter fuselage depend on the blade position the sensor oscillates with the frequency of rotor revolutions That oscillations are not harmonic and looks like a noise Observations from the gyroscope sensor are shown in Fig. 2 for the same time interval 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 1 Gyroscope measuruments: Roll and Pitch angular velocities  x   z time, seconds Fig 2.

Then adaptive Kalman filter was implemented for smoothing data and for calculation 


filter was implemented for smoothing data and for calculation of one step ahead prediction that is necessary for control design The coefficients of the model were estimated by data collected in a set of flights. We present here a subsystem only that describes dynamics of roll and pitch. The roll angular velocity ?x and the pitch angular velocity ?z are described by the equation x z  A  x z    ux uz    wx wz  where ux, uz are linear combinations of roll and pitch control applied to the swash plate, wx,wz are noises. The matrix A was identified as A 3.02 ?28.07 8.04 ?0.87   The variances of wx and wz were estimated as mean square model errors Consider the estimation problem with only one measurement obtained from the onboard sensor, and it is the roll angular velocity. The measurement is y\(t t t where t is the instant of measurement and v is the noise which is big. It is required to suppress this noise using the model and the corresponding Kalman filter. The variance of v is unknown and it is estimated by the procedure from Theorem 1 Let r be the disturbance to noise ratio in the Kalman filter It depends on the unknown variance v only. For any r &gt; 0 the corresponding Kalman filter gives a sequence of estimates of the angular velocities.

  12 5  C ONCLUSIONS  The investigations in this report yield three important conclusions for improving valid ation and verification of aerospace systems\222 performance requirements, and suggest a number of investigatory extensions. The improvements should be extensible to validation and verification of any performance requirement for any aerospace system Verification Planning Usi ng Conditional Approaches Reduces Numbers of Tests Required Conditional approaches are used as the basis for applying decision theory. Veri fication for aerospace systems always supports the decision making process for acceptance of the system. Therefore, verification planning using conditional approaches is suitable and appropriate for aerospace systems As demonstrated in section 2 of this report, conditional approaches can be used with models of maximum objectivity to eliminate most, if not all, questionable assumptions. This is not possible when developing a verification plan using classical statistical methods. As observed with the Orion LAS mission assurance requirement example, the use of maximum objectivity models in verification planning did not introduce any unnecessary inherent conserva tism, producing verification plans using fewer numbers of tests, with higher probabilities of verification success than those developed using classical statistical methods. This results in more cost feasible verification plans due to the reduced numbers of tests that need to be performed Requirements Validation is Improved by Using Historical Data When considering verification planning for a stringent aerospace system requirement, hi storical surrogate systems data may be used with conditional methods to investigate actual achieved requirement performance levels in both verification and operations as a function of residual risk Surrogate systems that were fiel ded, were verified to satisfy their performance requirements at stated verification risk levels, and were cost feasible in design, manufacturing, and verification. Conditional approaches allow this validation process to be performed without any knowledge of the actual requirements levied on the surrogate systems, and without using any indefensible assumptions As was observed in this report for the proposed mission assurance requirement for the Orion LAS, 41 surrogate systems actually performed close to the Orion LAS requirement in operations considering the aggregated data However, none of these surrogate systems were verified to the level of the proposed Orion LAS mission assurance requirement with the stated residual verification risk. This suggests that the industry that produced the surrogates, and that will produce the Orion LAS, may indeed design and built such systems to perform at levels that cannot be verified at those levels at a feasible cost. Relaxing the stringency of the Orion LAS mission assurance requirement to the 0.97 level for verification purposes should be valid based on results from processing the aggregate surrogate systems data Further, consider that the Ares I rocket will be designed manufactured, and verified by the same industry that does so for the Orion LAS. A 0.97 mission assurance for the Ares I means that there is a 3% risk of failure. The Orion LAS with a mission assurance requirement of 0.97 has a 3 risk of failing, given that the Ares I fails. With these values for mission assurance requirements for both vehicles, the actual risk of loss of crew due to failure of the Orion LAS when the Ares I fails is the product of these two risks, a 0.09% risk When ground test and flight data from surrogate systems is available, conditional approaches may be used to validate both the level of required performance and required maximum acceptable verification risk for the system of interest Greater Verification Plan Achievability and Feasibility Results from Combining Conditional Approaches with Historical Data Beyond the improvements offered to verification planning when using conditional approaches, the cost feasibility can be further improved if historical surrogate system data are available. As seen for verification of the Orion LAS mission assurance requirement in Table 5, once relaxed to a validated level, a verification plan taking advantage of the historical surrogate systems\222 ground test data can be developed that can be cost feasible, with a greatly improved probability of verification success Extensions to the Investigations Conditional approaches may be used to predict future system performance based on observed data, i.e., test results 7 n s id erin g th at an ticip ated use of the Orion LAS may be limited to fewer than 100 flights, it is possible to predict the probabilities for number of failures of the Orion LAS among a fixed number of flights, given numbers of surrogate ground test and fli ght successes and failures and actual Orion LAS verification results. Factoring these results into verification planni ng, coupled with requirements validation based on processing surrogate data using conditional approaches, may yield further improvements in cost feasibility for verification of stringent requirements for aerospace systems

well as from practitioners, is available, IL strategy including DWH/BI strategy IL strategies are addressed at all, either actual artifacts/documents are proposed without an integrating meta model/methodology, or the strategy making process is described without proposing specific and consistent result templates/structures Since it consumes a significant amount of resources and may constitute significant potentials for business, IL needs strategy. IL strategy must not be limited to hardware/software selection and architectural considerations, but should address the entire business scope of sourcing services, integrating acquired and self-made services into customer-oriented IL solutions, and delivering such solutions to create customer value Our survey of the state of IL strategy in practice reveals that IL sourcing, IL delivery and IL portfolio strategies are regarded as important strategy components. The larger companies are, the more international their focus is, and the more their IL is organized according to the CC model, the more components of a supply-chain oriented explicit IL strategy they are likely to have deployed The IIM model provides a suitable conceptual foundation for structuring such strategy components and also provides best practices from IT management which often can be easily adapted to IL. Regarding IL product/service development and maintenance certain functional oriented strategy sub-components are differentiated in our framework. These strategy components are adapted from an established data management functional framework in order to reflect IL specifics. While traditional, more technically oriented sub-components such as system and data architecture are covered in most companies, business oriented components like change management and project/business requirements management are covered less frequently. Additional research is necessary to develop appropriate solution components based on existing fragments and experiences Based on a more complete comprehension of IL strategy and its components, the strategy development and update process needs to be addressed in future research as well. Instead of developing and updating business strategies, IT strategies and IL strategies in independent processes, dependencies and cycles need to be addressed. A comprehensive understanding of IL strategy and respective processes may also serve as a foundation for establishing maturity models, reference models and best practices  References 1] Arnott, D. and G.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
