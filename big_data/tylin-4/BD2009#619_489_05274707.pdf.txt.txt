In this article an effective two-sided median filtering method to detect outliers in Flight Data is proposed, which makes use of the median computed from a local data point  s certain neighborhood window and the reasonable threshold to compare with the difference between the median and the observed data value. Then outliers are replaced by the appropriate medians in order to prevent from missing data in time series. It is essential of putting forward a credible and universal evaluation method to evaluate the result of outlier detection in Flight Data. This outlier detection method is efficiently and effectively used for preprocessing Flight Data and detecting the outliers in Flight Data Keywords  Flight Data, Outliers, median, evaluation coefficient I. INTRODUCTION Time series data are acquired sequentially over time just as large set of Flight Data, which is collected by FDR Flight Data Recorder other than those that are separated in time. Information extracted from Flight Data is used by monitoring Flight System, evaluating performance of plane and engine assisting judge of the flight trainings, analyzing and investigating the cause of an accident in order to prevent from failures. In these applications, more and more Flight Data points need to extract useful and high quality information, which can be supplied to engineers, pilots and other users with efficient analysis tools. Considering that, Flight Data are obtained in the form of signals that are captured by hundreds of sensors with different time stamps at various sampling frequencies. FDR is a kind of complicated electronic system, during its working distortion data and missing data, even the abnormal beginning or end of record and the like are occurred which are caused by noise and other electric disturbances[1][5]. As a result, the recorded Flight Data of FDR will contain some certain outliers or abnormal patterns, which have great impact on the analysis of whole Flight Data. It is necessary to purpose an effective and efficient approach to detect outliers in real time series. In this paper, our research is to study and validate an effective method to detect the outliers in Flight Data which is especially useful for analyzing and simulating the Flight signals collected form FDR Outliers can be defined as data points sampled in a time series that are different from the rest of the data points. There are two aspects of how to deal with outliers 1 data points when they are labeled as correct outliers. In this paper, an effective two-sided median filtering method to detect the outliers in the various types of flight signals recorded form FDR is purposed, and which doesn  t comply with any models and isn  t affected by unusual events or noises that create spurious effects in the series and result in extraordinary patterns Furthermore, outliers will be replaced by the reasonable data points closed to the actual data points at the sample time, which solve the problem of missing outliers in the time series. At the same time, it is essential to put forward a useful guide line and a key coefficient for estimating this method of outlier detection. The 


estimating this method of outlier detection. The two-sided median filtering method can deal effectively and quickly with the outliers in preprocess of Flight Data and can acquire the clean set of Flight Data to recur the actual process of flight This paper is organized as follows; In Section II we give an overview of the type of outliers in time series of Flight Data; In Section III we describe an method for outliers detecting using Flight Data in detail, which don  t relay on a specific time series model; In section 4 we discuss an evaluation for the result of outliers detection by using an evaluated coefficient. In section 5 we get conclusions from this study and point to future research ideas II. OUTLIERS IN FLIGHT DATA Outliers in Flight Data are distinctively different or unusual from the rest of other observed data points There are many different types of outliers in Flight Data The first type is an additional outlier, which is a measurement error at sample time and caused by factors outside the system of FDR. For example, a machine breakdown or human error could result in an additive outlier when the FDR is sampling the data. The second type of outliers is an outlier that caused by noise or other disturbance from the outside of system, which is different from the first one due to the latter will eventually return to normal. The Third type is an outlier that occurs at different phase of flight, which implies a permanent change during the flight. For example, a sort of changes is from climb to cruise of a flight 4-797 _____________________________ 978-1-4244-3864-8/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE The Ninth International Conference on Electronic Measurement &amp; Instruments  ICEMI  2009 It is important to consider the possibility of different outlier types occurring at the same period when FDR has recorded Flight Data for many times, because the outliers are random and can  t be controlled by ourselves. It may not be always practical to use the traditional method of outlier detection depended on the known module under the fact of outliers occurring randomly. When the two-sided median filtering method to detect outliers in Flight Data is proposed, it will not be limited by the module and can detect the three types of outliers above at the same time. Judging from the definition of outliers in Flight Data, our method only concerns whether the observed data point is outlier or not relatively to its neighborhood or local data points III. TWO-SIDED MEDIAN FLITERING METHOD According to the median of a neighborhood of data points and the appropriate threshold to determine whether a local data point in time series is outlier or not one by one. Given a time series, for example, the signal of altitude in the set of Flight Data sampled from FDR j u s t  a s  i t  i s       2 1  N y y y      D e f i n e d  t h e  n e i g h b o r h o o d  of the point ty  in the altitude signal, },,,,,{ 11 ktttkt k t  y y y y y       w h e r e  2 k  i s  the width of the neighborhood window, whose range is f r o m  k t     t o  k t      C o m p u t i n g  t h e  n e i g h b o r h o o d  median ktm of the point ty  is aimed to detect the outliers, through comparing the difference between ty and  k tm . Computing the absolute difference value between ty  and  k tm , which is compared with the 


tm , which is compared with the s p e c i f i c  t h r e s h o l d   I f       k t t  m y    k e e p s  t y      E l s e      k t t  m y    l a b e l e d  t y  a s  o u t l i e r  a n d  replaced ty with  k tm Finally, according to the above process of data points one by one, the clean data points can be obtained without the labeled outliers, the set of clean data points is },,,{ **2  1  N y y y      c l o s e  t o  t h e  a c t u a l  s a m p l e d  d a t a  p o i n t s  f r o m  F D R   T h e  a p p r o p r i a t e  t h r e s h o l d    n e e d s  transcendent knowledge of Flight Data and can be obtained by training repeatedly. The two-sided median filtering method is one method of supervised trainings through learning from the trainings, the suitable and i m p o r t a n t  p a r a m e t e r    a n d  k  c a n  b e  a c q u i r e d  c o r r e c t l y  and can be used to detect the outliers in Flight Data. The two-sided median filtering method is illustrated with a simple example in Fig. 1 with a neighborhood window with of k = 3 Fig.1  Module of two-sided filtering method Two-sided median filtering method makes use of the local median computed by the neighborhood window and comparing with the observed point in order to detect the outliers in Flight Data, which improves and advances the correctness of confirming the median computed by the whole data points. Taking the altitude flight signal of a sortie for instance; the data value range from taking off to cruise is quite different. As it is mentioned in [2], they detail the method of outlier detection by using the median of the whole data points. In this way, the accuracy of the compared median will be reduced greatly and affect the result of outliers detection The choice of the value of the width of neighborhood window, parameter k, and the value of threshold p a r a m e t e r      b o t h  o f  t h e m  d e p e n d  o n  a n a l y z i n g  t h e  Flight Data points. Considering that, the width of neighborhood window and the threshold is respectively changed along with the different stages of flight signal The altitude of the aircraft, roll angle and other signals obtained from a Flight Data recorder has different range of data in the stages of taking off, climb, cruise, approach and landing, according that the different value of k and   f o r  d e t e c t i n g  t h e  o u t l i e r s  m u s t  b e  a p p l i e d  i n  d i f f e r e n t  stages of aircraft. Therefore, a larger threshold value is more appropriate for take-off and landing, a smaller threshold value is performed well in the stage of cruise In order to illustrate the two-sided method of outlier detection, taking the altitude signal for example, which is measured in feet and obtained at rate of 1 second from a FDR of a civil aircraft,  has 7260 items of record and includes five stages, taking-off, climb, cruise, approach a n d  l a n d i n g   A t  t h e  s a m e  t i m e  k    3  a n d      8 0 0 t   g e n e r a l l y  t h e  v a l u e  o f    i s  o b t a i n e d  b y  e n g i n e e r i n g  experience The actual value of altitude data points obtained from FDR are illustrated by the following figure, which is total of 7260 items 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 x 104  


     Fig.2  The actual signal of altitude 4-798 The Ninth International Conference on Electronic Measurement &amp; Instruments  ICEMI  2009 After using the two-sided median filtering method the result delicates that correct outliers occur at the time of 508s, 826s?5254s, just as labeled in the Fig.2 and are replaced by the appropriate medians. In the Fig.3, the red line describes the primary data points and the blue line shows the cleaning data points. But in Fig.3 there are some normal data points detected as outliers neighbored with the actual outliers, you can find them inside the blue circle in Fig.3 F i g  3   T h e  r e s u l t  o f  d e t e c t i n g  w h e r e  k  3  a n d     8 0 0   Through magnifying the data point value of 8200ft at 508s in Fig.4 indicated by the red arrow, it is the correct outlier in series and replaced by the median value of 15600feet Fig.4  The local outlier data at 580s Analyzing the result of detecting outliers where p a r a m e t e r s  k  3  a n d     8 0 0   t h e  w h o l e  o u t l i e r s  c a n  b e  detected from the whole record data points, however some normal data points are also mislabeled as outliers In order to avoid non-outliers mislabeled and assess the effectiveness of the two-sided median filtering method, a standard coefficient and a guide line for the method of outlier detection is proposed IV. ESTIMATED COEFFICIENT AND  GUIDE LINE Although this two-sided median filtering method is reasonable and effective, which can removal the outliers in Flight Data and replace the missing outliers with appropriate median closed to actual data points. However if you pay more attention on that the non-outliers are mislabeled sometimes, for example, as it is illustrated in Fig.4, at 507s the value of altitude is 16000ft, at next time point 508s is 8200ft, clearly the data at 508s is outlier but both of them are labeled as outliers. Now the time point at 507s can be described as false positive and other data points in Fig.4, such as 505s, 506s, and 509s is the same false positive points. Judging from the result of outlier detection and classifying the result as four types just as it is shown in Table 1 Table1. Classify the result of outliers as four types Result of detection Non-outliers Outliers Non-outliers Data points are neither outliers nor labeled as outliers, A Data points are not Outliers but labeled as outliers, B Outliers Data points are not outliers but labeled as outliers, C Data points are outliers and labeled as outliers, D Category A, the total number of normal data points are the most of normal data points in the whole set of Flight Data, which is less important to detect objective outliers. Category B is not outliers but is detected as 


outliers. Category B is not outliers but is detected as outliers, which can affect the degree of effectiveness more easily. Concluding form the result of the pervious experiment, it dedicates that the smaller number of Category B and the more effective of the method. When t h e  l a r g e r  w i d t h  o f  w i n d o w  a n d  t h e  s m a l l e r  v a l u e  o f  s used in the training of method, the normal data points can be mislabeled as outliers and will result in increasing the number of Category B. Category C is the number of outliers which can not detected as outliers, which is c a u s e d  b y  w h e n    i s  m o r e  l a r g e r  a n d  t h e  v a l u e  o f   k t t  m y    i s  l e s s  t h a n  t h e  n o r m a l  v a l u e   t y  i s  d e s c r i b e d  as the normal data points. Category D is outliers and correctly detected as outliers The ideal situation is that the number of B and C is least even the number is zero and the number of A and D is closed to the number of normal data points and outliers respectively, namely our purpose is to minimizing the number of B and C and maximizing the number of D. So define the standard coefficient J as the following equation             1 1 k kkkkk k k D CBDCB D J 1 J coefficient is inversely proportional to Category B and C, directly proportional to the correct detection of the outliers or Category D. However, it puts equal cost for both B and C, the larger the coefficient, the more effective of the two-sided median filtering method during detecting the outliers using of the two-sided 4-799 The Ninth International Conference on Electronic Measurement &amp; Instruments  ICEMI  2009 median method, it is perfect when both minimizing the number of B, C and maximizing the number of D[3][4 Taking the altitude of flight data experiment for example, parameter k stands for the choice of the width of the neighbourhood window, which has more important relation to compute the median using how many numbers of data points, the larger the value of k the more points of computing the median and spending more time to compute the median, selecting the width p a r a m e t e r   i  e    1 5   5  3    k    T h e  p a r a m e t e r    s t a n d s  f o r  t h e  t h r e s h o l d  o f  o u t l i e r  d e t e c t i o n   w h i c h  i s  used to compute the difference between the median and t h e  o b s e r v e d  d a t a  p o i n t   T h e  d i f f e r e n c e  i s    k t t  m y    it is larger than the threshold, so the observed data point will be labeled as an outlier. Selecting appropriate value o f     n e e d s  t h e  e n g i n e e r i n g  k n o w l e d g e   w h i c h  c h a n g e s  along with the signal from the Flight Data recorder. Just

CONCLUSION The approach of outlier detection using two-sided median filtering in this paper is not only used to detect the local outliers, but also can label the global outliers Furthermore, the standard guide line and coefficient can be extended to other method of outlier detection Using our method to analyze the whole recorded Flight Data of FDR will achieve success and obtain correct results, because it is only related with the fore-and-aft data of the local data points. But if the method is used to real time analyze, it will have a little difficulty to deal with the real time data points, which are located before the local observed data points, two-sided median filtering method will not perform well under this situation. More and more future work of detection outlier needs to be completed well in order to deal with the real time situation There are much more work to do in the future, just as how to deal with the outliers in real-time Flight Data signals, how to estimate the approach of outlier detection using the guide line and develop an applied platform for detecting and analyzing the outliers, which is promising to be applied in the Flight Data Management System or Monitor System ACKNOWLEDGMENT I would like to thank my tutor for supporting and giving me much of guide on this work.

                 Figure 1. Extended theory of borders. Adapted from Brunet-Jailly  The proposed framework can be used to examine the influence of a variety of contextual factors such as market forces and trade flows, policy activities of multiple governments on adjacent borders, and the political clout and culture of borderland communities on information sharing and collaboration initiatives  4. Conclusion  Globalization and regionalization are drawing the attention of practitioners and scholars alike Governments at all levels working within border regions borders, in particular, are finding it necessary to work together in new ways to leverage the benefits of working globally as well as regionally. Working together across boundaries and borders rests on sharing information. This paper has contributed an extended border theory that integrates current research in crossboundary information sharing with widely accepted theory on borders Future research is necessary to empirically test t he utility of the proposed theory as a tool for understanding this new area of both practical and theoretical importance  5  Acknowledgements  The authors want to thank Jochen Scholl, Jane Fountain, Jeffrey Roy, and Rodrigo Sandoval for their valuable comments to early versions of this paper.

Discussion and conclusion  6.1. Discussion of findings  The secondary data analyses in this study were able to demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between the institutional environment and e-commerce adoption.  Specifically speaking, the legal and policy environment did exert a substantial positive impact on e-commerce adoption around the world at the early stage of e-commerce \(the worldwide average score of e-commerce was only 5.51 out of 10 in the EIU 2003 sample government financial support of e-commerce and related infrastructure projects, effectiveness of legal framework, and laws covering e-commerce, together they fostered consumers and businesses in many countries to engage in e-commerce in 2003.  This finding proved the institutional perspective about the critical role of government policy and legal environment in driving e-commerce adoption Four years later, in 2007, the global average score of e-commerce improved from 5.51 to 6.37, at a rate of 16%.  As e-commerce became more prevalent in the world, supportive government policy still provided a powerful explanation for variations in e-commerce adoption around the world.  On the other hand, the impact of legal environment was reduced.  A possible explanation from the perspective of institutionalism is that a predictive and effective legal environment was important to reduce the institutional uncertainty and ensure the trust and confidence in e-commerce activities, especially during the initial stage of ecommerce development.  A good legal system is a safeguard for online commercial transactions Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal 


Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
