ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEM  3.1 Overview For environmental evaluation of a manufacturing system, it is necessary to consider the whole life cycle of a manufacturing system in addition to its operation where actual production is executed. The life cycle stages or phases of a manufacturing system for which significant environmental impacts may occur are: planning construction/reconfiguration, operation and recycling Recycling includes reuse, material recycling and proper disposal of system components after retirement of the system For a correct evaluation of environmental impact, it is mandatory to consider all three stages, but the importance of the respective stages may vary according to the objectives of the evaluation and manufacturing system characteristics. In situations where manufacturing technology is mature and manufacturing systems are used for a long period, an operation stage has greater importance. In situations where manufacturing systems are frequently constructed or re-configured due to rapid technology innovation and market changes, a recycling stage becomes more important This International Standard is focused on manufacturing systems that consist of relatively complicated manufacturing machines/facilities, which are used for a long time. These systems perform in various modalities: discrete parts/products production in mass production, variable products/variable volume production, and small volume/one-piece production. In such situations, environmental impact during system operation is very important. Therefore an evaluation method is important and mandatory for an operation stage, and impact evaluation at the planning construction/reconfiguration and recycling stages is optional. Environmental impact during operation is evaluated using information about input and output of materials, energy and other subsidiary resources used or   Fig. 1 Manufacturing system Life cycle and Product Life cycle  produced by the systems. In addition to material input/output, input/output resources concerned with system maintenance and standby mode must be Facility plan construction reconfiguration Facility Maintenance

In this evaluation, manufacturing systems themselves are considered as target products for LCA analysis An environmental evaluation index is determined using the concept of environmental efficiency, which is defined as a function of system value and system environmental impact  Environmental_efficiency = F \(System_value System_environmental_impact  1  Based on this concept, appropriate functions F are elaborated by considering evaluation objectives production conditions and associated environmental impacts. Generally speaking, system value and system environmental impact are measured by different units Therefore a value of an environmental efficiency index itself has no essential meaning. For environmental efficiency evaluation, a reference system is set up. A relative value of index values of a target system and a reference system is a valid evaluation for environmental efficiency For system environmental impact evaluation, a manufacturing system boundary shall be clearly defined A basic unit for evaluation is a  process  as shown in Figure 2. A process may be defined as a machine tool, a production line or a factory, etc depending on the objectives of evaluation. By combining several processes with their input and output, an aggregate process may be defined This process may 


This process may be the target for environmental impact evaluation For this evaluation the constituents of a process are activities, which cannot be decomposed further, or are not necessary to be  1 ISO 14044: Environmental management  Life cycle assessment  Requirement and guideline decomposed further for the evaluation. Those activities are "unit processes" as defined by the standardized LCA method. A unit process may consist of activities by several manufacturing machines/facilities, or several unit processes may correspond to an activity by a manufacturing machine/facility. Details are discussed in Part 3 In this International Standard, resource refers to physical materials and energy. All input and output across the system boundary shall be enumerated and evaluated The input and output of the unit process, illustrated in Figure 2, is classified in horizontal and vertical directions. Input and output in horizontal direction represents the resource flow related with  direct environmental impact  which is directly caused by individual product production. Input and output in vertical direction represents the resource flow related with  indirect environmental impact  which is caused by the facility life cycle, such as facility construction operation, maintenance and disposal Resource flow in the horizontal direction consists of energy, material and product which are directly used/consumed by product production and/or contained in the output products. The resource flow includes  material    resource    product  and  residue    Material  consists of raw material and parts for product production  Resource  consists of energy and other consumed resources for product production  Product   represents the target products for the manufacturing system concerned  Residue  consists of all input resource flow which is not contained in the target products.

The first one is  Facility  flow and it occurs in long time interval  Facility  flow represents  Facility Construction/Reconfiguration Resources  and  Facility Reuse/Recycle/Disposal    Facility Construction/Reconfiguration Resources  is evaluated by LCA analysis, considering that the constructed system is treated as a target product for 


constructed system is treated as a target product for LCA analysis. The same consideration is applied for  Facility Reuse/Recycle/Disposal  to derive the environmental impact by that process. Because reuse/recycling processes are not yet standardized particular reuse/recycling processes shall be clearly defined and the associated environmental impact shall be added to the total system impact. System value for the system to be recycled shall be removed from the total system value, in case where a still working manufacturing system is recycled due to economical and other reasons. This evaluation for system value is not yet standardized, and a particular evaluation method shall be clearly explained The second one of the resource flow in the vertical direction is  Facility Operation  flow, and it occurs continuously with facility operation  Facility Operation  flow represents various kinds of resource flow related with facility operation. It includes  Facility Maintenance Resource    Facility Standby Mode Resource    Utility Operation Resource    Facility Maintenance Residue    Facility Standby Mode Residue  and  Utility Operation Residue    Utility Operation Resource  and  Utility Operation Residue   represent resource flow related with utility operations such as oil/water/chemicals/gas/air supply/treatment system, air conditioning, lighting, and on-site power generation Evaluation shall be performed for a specified time interval, such as a month or a year. Some input may be instantly processed and output is generated. Some input stays within a system boundary and may be used after some amount of time. In some cases, input resources stay within a system boundary, without any direct output, during the evaluation interval. Similarly, output may be generated without any direct input  Facility Maintenance Resources  and  Facility Maintenance Residue  may correspond to those cases  3.3 Proposed method By considering all of the resources crossing the system boundary, system environmental impact due to the manufacturing system is evaluated by summing the environmental impact from all system unit process inputs and outputs  Environmental_impact  _Unit process  Resource + Residue + Facility Facility _operation}         \(2  NOTE: All variables in \(2 environmental impacts  System value shall be evaluated by the following expression  System_value _Unit process  Product_value \(3  Environmental impact due to manufacturing system construction and recycling shall be calculated according to the LCA method, by considering the target manufacturing system as a product for LCA evaluation Comprehensive evaluation of system construction and recycling stages may become very complicated Consistent with the objectives of the evaluation, system construction and recycling evaluation shall be performed with appropriate details 


performed with appropriate details Procedures for environmental impact evaluation are defined in Part 3 At the time of disposal of obsolete components of manufacturing systems, if the components are still active, or have some production capability, and are reused for other manufacturing systems, environmental impact corresponding to this remaining capability may be removed from the manufacturing system evaluation if it was previously included. If the disposed component is effectively used for another purpose, then some part of construction environmental impact of the disposed component may be subtracted from the manufacturing system construction impact In case of component disposal without reuse system value of the disposed component from current status until complete expenditure of its capability should be subtracted from the manufacturing system value. No generally accepted procedure for active system or component disposal exist, therefore it should be explicitly specified An environmental evaluation index shall be defined using the concept of environmental efficiency Environmental efficiency shall take the form of an expression \(4  Environmental efficiency = F \(System_value System_environmental_ impact 4  Explicit definition of a function F depends on respective use cases given in Part 4 of this standard. For example, one of the definitions is given as  Environmental_efficiency = System_value System_environmental_ impact  \(5  Where system value generally is defined as useful physical output or added value from manufacturing system operations, e.g. products themselves, product 2411 functions, or profit; and environmental impact is calculated based on system inventory data throughout the manufacturing system's life cycle by applying the method of Life Cycle Assessment. As system value and system environmental impact are calculated on different measure, the ratio of the target system environmental efficiency and some reference system environmental efficiency is valid for evaluation  3.4 Data for Environmental Evaluation To perform an environmental impact evaluation of manufacturing system, information concerning manufacturing activity is necessary. By clearly defining these information data items, it is possible to perform unambiguous environmental evaluation. The details of such data items and their data format are defined in Part 5 of this International Standard. Where generally accepted environmental intensity data for unit process are available, they are also given in Part 5 Many of the data related to manufacturing system definition and operation have been standardized already in related international standards. In such cases, existing standards are referred to and extended, as necessary Some examples of categories for essential data items are Manufacturing machine /facility \(machine tools, conveyers, etc Tool and jig/fixture Energy Materials Product \(definition, quality, function, etc 


Product \(definition, quality, function, etc Process plan Production plan Other production resources Environmental evaluation data \(intensity data, impact factors, etc  Using these categories of data, evaluation procedures for an environmental index may be defined. Using a commonly available data format, it then becomes possible for public organizations and machine/facility producers to publish information useful for generating indices of environmental efficiency. By relying on such public data with precise specification of data format and definition, reliable and unambiguous environmental evaluation may be realized  3.5 Evaluation and allocation of indirect impact The unit process model, illustrated in Figure 2, is designed for ensuring the consistency of each view summary impact of  manufacturing system view  and  product view   Indirect environmental impact model is defined in Part 6, for establishing the method for the evaluation of Indirect environmental impact and allocation them onto the direct impact of production The knowledge and best practice of cost accountings are to be applied to this part, such for measuring and evaluating the indirect environmental impact and allocating them to the proper direct environmental impact element  3.6 Model description language The data models for environmental evaluation method are defined in following parts Part 3:  Guidelines for environmental evaluation procedures Part 4:  Environmental evaluation index model Part 5:  Environmental evaluation data model Part 6:  Indirect environmental impact model For describing the data models for environmental evaluation method, a formal language is to be employed for providing the interpretable representation which is to be human readable and computer procurable   4.

Since B  v monotone increasing in v the demand for the service is characterized as follows. Consider the highest valuation user with vv  By \(4\her precaution effort will be the highest among users, so is her net benefit If  0 Bv  then  0 Bv  for all 0 v  and all other users would not buy.  However, if  0 Bv  but  00 B  there exists users with v such that  the other users with vvv  would buy  Proof of Lemma 1  By Observations 1 and 3 respectively f is increasing in a and v is decreasing in a Accordingly L  a monotonically decreasing in a Further, if a 0, all users would choose f 0.

The complete proofs are available upon request users would buy the service, and so L 0\0. With regard to attacker s effort, by Observation 4 a is monotonically increasing in L Further, if L 0, then attacker will not target the service a 0. Since the functions L  a nd a  L are continuous as shown in Figure 2, they have a non-trivial intersection, say a  L  Proof of Proposition 1 Expanding \(8\o distinguish between the precaution of end-user v denoted f  v the precautions of all other users f      1 1   1 1      1    vv a v vfdv dC da vfvdv vfdv         A4 By \(A4\ an increase in precautions f by all other users except v would reduce the overall conditional loss represented in the brackets of the left-hand side, and hence induce attacker to reduce attacking effort.  This would imply a decreasing in the attacking effectiveness a User v adjusts her precaution following the ne t-benefit maximizing function represented by equation \(4\.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
