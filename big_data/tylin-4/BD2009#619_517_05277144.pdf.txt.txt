Energy technology development is a crucial key considering Korea's national energy security and environments. In this study, we establish the criteria list and prioritize relative weights of criteria and sub-criteria for assessing and selecting strategic Big-sized R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development. A fuzzy AHP approach, which integrates fuzzy theory into analytic hierarchy process \(AHP thoughts and perception as making pairwise comparisons of criteria and alternatives. The fundamental data of this research results will support R&amp;D planning phase for policy makers as selecting strategic R&amp;D programs for producing well focused R&amp;D outcomes I. INTRODUCTION Korea depends on 98% imports of energy resources consumed and takes the 9th place in CO2 emissions. In addition, she takes the 1st place of CO2 emissions increasing rate. Considering the current statue of UNFCCC, Korea will be expected to the Annex I nation thanks to Korean energy environments and the quantity of CO2 emission. Energy technology development is a key factor to breakthrough the Korea  s current status of energy index and national energy security. Moreover, strategic energy technology development is the second energy resource acquisition and one of best alternatives for coping with future sustainable development as government sponsored research institute Korean government has concentrated its efforts on strategic investment in energy technology development such as new and renewable energy technologies including energy  This research was made possible by R&amp;D funds provided by KIER and the Hydrogen Energy R&amp;D Center, MEST, Korea S.K.

Korea established Korea  s national energy and resource 10 years plan for well focused R&amp;D in 2005. KIER, government supported research institute for developing energy technologies, established the strategic energy technology roadmap for the next 10 years from 2006 until 2015 [1, 2 This paper attempts to assess and select the criteria list for big-sized R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development based on the relative weight of criteria and sub-criteria accrued using the fuzzy integrated analytic hierarchy process \(fuzzy AHP extended multi-criteria decision making method The Fuzzy AHP approach effectively reflects the fuzziness of human linguistic values and alternatives when it comes to making pairwise comparison judgments in the real world. On 


making pairwise comparison judgments in the real world. On the other hand, the AHP approach is less effective to reflect human linguistic values than the fuzzy AHP approach since it provides the crisp values as making pairwise comparisons of criteria and alternatives comparing with the range values of the fuzzy AHP approach. In addition, real world decision-making problems are associated with much more complex and the fuzzy AHP approach is more effective to capture of linguistic values than the AHP approach The AHP, which was developed by Prof. Saaty in the early 1970s, is a subjective and easy tool with which to analyze based on a crisp 9-point scale, the qualitative criteria needed to generate alternative priorities and preferences [3 The AHP enables decision makers to structure complex problems in a simple hierarchical form, and to evaluate a large number of quantitative and qualitative factors in a systematic manner despite the presence of multiple conflicting criteria. The AHP has proven to be a powerful decision analysis technique in the area of multi-criteria decision making \(MCDM to the tackling of MCDM problems. In general, the AHP has been utilized in various areas such as R&amp;D planning, the selection of the best policy alternatives once a set of alternatives has been identified, the allocation of  resources the determination of requirements, prediction of outcomes design systems, measurement of performance, and the optimization and resolution of decision conflicts [4, 5]. To this end, Lee was the first to apply the AHP approach to the forging of long-term improvements in national energy efficiency and GHG control plans as part of the formulation of Korea  s national energy policy [6 This paper establishes the criteria and sub-criteria and allocates the relative weights of them as selecting strategic Fuzzy Integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process Approach for Selecting Strategic Big-sized R&amp;D Programs in the Sector of Energy Technology Development S.

Kim    Big-sized R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development using the fuzzy integrated AHP approach, in which the decision maker  s pairwise comparison judgments are represented as fuzzy triangular numbers. Moreover, this study employs 6 criteria, namely energy environment \(EE economical spin-off \(ES TS marketability \(M KM C factors with which to select strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs for producing well focused R&amp;D outcomes. This study also effectuates the weights of pairwise comparisons of criteria and sub-criteria and they were also synthesized. The results of this paper will provide energy policy makers with the strategic scientific approach needed to effectuate the selection of well focused R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development, as well as the fundamental data required to forge energy policy decision and planning phase The paper unfolds in the following fashion: Section II introduces the fuzzy set and fuzzy numbers. Section III describes the fuzzy AHP approach. Section IV deals with the hierarchy of the criteria used to select a strategic big-sized R&amp;D program in the energy technology development sector In Section V, an illustrative example of the fuzzy integrated AHP approach is presented. The conclusion is then carried out in Section VI  II. FUZZY SET AND FUZZY NUMBERS In the real world, precise data pertaining to measurement indicators is very hard to extract from human judgments. This is because human preferences encompass a degree of uncertainty, and decision makers may very well be reluctant 


uncertainty, and decision makers may very well be reluctant or unable to assign crisp numerical values to comparison judgments. Decision makers also prefer natural language expressions over exact numbers when assessing criteria and alternatives. Fuzzy set theory deals with ambiguous or not well defined situations. By approximating information and uncertainty where the generation of reasonable alternatives to problems needing decisions is concerned, it effectively resembles human thoughts and perceptions The concept of fuzzy theory was first introduced by Zadeh in 1965 [7]. Fuzzy theory includes elements such as fuzzy set membership function, and the fuzzy numbers used to efficiently change vague information into useful data Fuzzy set theory uses groups of data with boundaries that feature lower, median, and upper values that are not sharply defined. Because most of the decision-making in the real world takes place amidst situations where pertinent data and the sequences of possible actions are not precisely known, the merit of using the fuzzy approach is that it expresses the relative importance of the alternatives and the criteria with fuzzy numbers rather than crisp ones. A fuzzy set is characterized by a membership function, which assigns a membership range value between 0 and 1 to each criterion and alternative Triangular fuzzy numbers \(TFN numbers are usually employed to capture the vagueness of the parameters related to the selection of the alternatives. In order to reflect the fuzziness which surrounds the decision makers when they select alternatives or conduct a pairwise comparison judgment matrix, TFN is expressed with boundaries instead of crisp numbers. In this research, we use TFN to select a strategic big-sized R&amp;D program of developing energy technology. TFN is designated as Mij = \(lij mij, uij uij are the left and right side of fuzzy number Mij respectively Consider two TFN M1 and M2, M1 = \(l1, m1, u1 l2 m2, u2     212121222111 uummllumluml +++=?            \(1    212121222111 uummllumluml  2   111 1 111 lmuuml  3  III. FUZZY ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS  Under the AHP, the decision-making process is modified into a hierarchical structure. At each level of the hierarchy AHP uses pairwise comparison judgments and matrix algebra to identify and estimate the relative priorities of criteria and alternatives. This in turn is carried out by breaking down a problem into its smaller constituent parts. The AHP thus leads from simple pairwise comparison judgments to priorities arranged within a hierarchy [8]. However, the AHP cannot take into account uncertainty when assessing and tackling a problem effectively. However, the fuzzy AHP can tackle fuzziness or the problem of vague decision making more efficiently by using fuzzy scales with lower, median, and upper values. This can be contrasted with the AHP  s crisp 9-points scale and synthesis of the relative weights using fuzzy sets, membership functions, and fuzzy numbers Although the AHP is employed herein to capture experts   knowledge acquired through perceptions or preferences, the AHP still cannot effectively reflect human thoughts with its  crisp numbers. Therefore, fuzzy AHP, an extension of the AHP model, is applied to resolve hierarchical fuzzy decision making problems [9, 10 TABLE I

We use the fuzzy scale when decision makers conduct pairwise comparison judgments with regards to criteria and alternatives. Let A=\(aij judgment matrix.

HIERARCHY OF CRITERIA The selection of strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs of developing energy technologies consists of two-tier criteria which are level 1 and 2. The hierarchy structure of the criteria is shown in Fig. 1   Fig. 1.  Hierarchy of criteria  At the top of the control hierarchy, there exists the goal of this problem. The goal is to select strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development for producing well focused R&amp;D outcomes. At level 1, there exist six criteria: energy environment \(EE 


exist six criteria: energy environment \(EE spin-off \(ES TS M KIER mission \(KM C 3 sub-criteria, namely high oil prices, UNFCCC, and hydrogen economy. ES is composed of energy savings and CO2 reduction. TS consists of technology development urgency, technology level/target level, and possibility of commercialization. M is composed of domestic/foreign market size, market size for exportation, and job creation effects. KM consists of national policy connection, public sector, and international capacity. C is composed of benefit of investment and investment size    V. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE A peer-review process was conducted. All in all, 10 responses were received. 10 of the experts which took part in the peer-reviews responded that consistency should be maintained, and the calculation of the weights of the 6 criteria and other sub-criteria should be synthesized.

CONCLUSIONS A fuzzy integrated analytic hierarchy process approach model for selecting a strategic big-sized R&amp;D program in the sector of energy technology development was established in this paper as an extended model of the AHP approach. We demonstrated herein the results compiled when the fuzzy integrated multi-criteria decision making method approach was employed. We created a one-tier hierarchy structure and established the list of criteria and sub-criteria using 6 criteria namely energy environment \(EE ES technical spin-off \(TS M KM C weights of sub-criteria using fuzzy integrated AHP approach using triangular fuzzy numbers. In terms of criteria list, which was based the fuzzy AHP approach, technical spin-off ranks first, followed by KIER mission, economical spin-off 


first, followed by KIER mission, economical spin-off marketability, energy environment, and cost. Although the quantitative data presented in this paper, which garnered by the peer reviews of experts, is limited, we have efficiently demonstrated the selection of a big-sized R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development based on the fuzzy integrated analytic hierarchy process with triangular fuzzy numbers Finally, this research provides energy policy makers with the fundamental data needed to establish the framework of a strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs for producing well focused R&amp;D outcomes instead of simple outputs. As a further study of this research, we are planning to apply the fuzzy integrated analytic network process approach [12] and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process/data envelopment analysis hybrid model for measuring the relative efficiency of a strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs from an econometric viewpoint [13-16  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We wish to express our gratitude to the expert who participated in the peer-review process  NOMENCLATURE AHP:   Analytic hierarchy process C:    Cost CI:    Consistency index CR:    Consistency ratio DEA:   Data envelopment analysis EE:    Energy environment    ES:    Economical spin-off KIER:   Korea institute of energy research KM:    KIER mission M :    Marketability HE:    Hydrogen economy HERC:   Hydrogen energy R&amp;D center HOP:   High oil prices MCDM:  Multi-criteria decision making method TS:    Technical spin-off UNFCCC: United nations framework convention of climate change  REFERENCES 1] S.K.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
