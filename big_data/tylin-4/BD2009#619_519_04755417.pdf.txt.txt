Multiwavelets for Quantitative Pattern Matching Bruce Kessler Western Kentucky University bruce.kessler@wku.edu Abstract The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to the concepts of wavelets and multiwavelets, and explain how these tools can be used by the analyst community to nd patterns in quantitative data. Three multiwavelet bases are introduced, the GHM basis from [3], a piecewise polynomial basis with approximation order 4 from [2 and a smoother approximation-order-4 basis developed by the author in previous work [6]. The technique of using multiwavelets to nd patterns is illustrated in a trac-analysis example 1. Introduction The concept of wavelets and wavelet analysis is a relatively new idea in the science of analysis which has been dominated over the last 200 years by Fourier analysis. Even newer is the concept of multiwavelets, which have greater exibility for handling boundaries, symmetries, and anti-symmetries The purpose of this paper is to provide the network security community an overview of the concept, and some of the bases that are available for their use 1.1 Multiresolution Analyses A function ! that satises the dilation equation  s 2 X q5Z fq!\(2{ q 1 for some sequence of coecients fq is said to be renable. A simple example of a renable function would be the characteristic function over [0> 1 0>1  1 for 0  { ? 1 0 otherwise> \(2 shown in Figure 1, since for ! = "[0>1  s 2  1s 2 2 2 


2{ 1   A renable function ! that has the property that the set q is a linearly independent set is called a scaling function. A scaling function ! where the dilation equation \(1 R  q  1 for q = 0 0 for q 5 Z> q 6= 0 is called an orthogonal scaling function. The function ! = "[0>1 2 translates, is called the Haar basis, and is an orthogonal scaling function due to its very short support Figure 1: The orthogonal scaling function 0>1 A multiresolution analysis \(MRA integrable functions dened on R \(typically denoted O2\(R Ys following criteria       Y2  Y1  Y0  Y1  Y2        S s5Z Ys = O2\(R  T s5Z Ys = {0 i 5 Y0 i i\(2m   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE there exists a function ! whose integer translates form a basis \(minimal spanning set the space Y0 Based on these criteria, scaling functions can clearly be used to generate MRA?s. The orthogonal complement of Y0 in Y1 is typically denoted Z0, and a function # whose integer translates form a basis for this space are called wavelets. The wavelet associated with the Haar basis is shown in Figure 2 Figure 2: The wavelet associated with the Haar basis If we dene similar spaces Zm as the orthogonal complement in Ym1 in Ym for all integer m, called wavelet spaces, then we may decompose a function in Y0 into increasingly ?smoother? approximations 


and keep the error in the wavelet spaces. An simple example of this process is shown in Figures 3 through 6 using the Haar basis Figure 3: A signal in the space Y0 generated by integer translates of the Haar basis Since # 5 Z1, by necessity # will satisfy a dilation equation of its own  s 2 X q5Z gq#\(2{ q for some sequence of coecients gq. For example the Haar wavelet # illustrated in Figure 2 satises the equation Figure 4: A best approximation in Y1 of the signal in Figure 3 at top, and the error in Z1 at bottom Figure 5: A best approximation in Y2 of the signal in Figure 4 at top, and the error in Z2 at bottom Figure 6: A best approximation in Y3 of the signal in Figure 5 at top, and the error in Z3 at bottom Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2  s 2  1s 2 2 2 2{ 1   In the case where the MRA is generated by an orthogonal scaling vector, the coecients fq and gq can be used to construct perfect-reconstruction lters for decomposing and reconstructing the original function in Y0 The approximation order of a scaling function refers to the highest degree polynomials that, when limited to a nite interval, are present in the space Y0 generated by the scaling function. A scaling function of approximation order n is able to reproduce degree n  1 polynomials exactly. For exam 


ple, the scaling function ! = "[0>1 that contains degree zero \(constant a nite interval [d> e], d, e integers, so we say that has approximation order 1. The approximation order of a scaling function will be an important deciding factor when we start to consider bases for applications 1.2 Wavelets vs. Fourier Analysis The fast Fourier transform \(FFT velous tool for isolating the frequencies in a discrete, uniformly-sampled signal, but it has its limitations. The FFT is a computationally ecient method of calculating the coecients dq and eq q = 0> = = = >Q  1, needed to represent a sampled signal {|n}Q1n=0 as the sum n Q1X q=0  dq cos  2 Q qn  eq sin  2 Q qn  for each n = 0> = = = >Q  1. Typically, one looks at the moduli of the various complex numbers dq+eql called the power spectrum, for an indication that the signal has a component that oscillates q times over the length of the signal. A modulus of zero means that that frequency is not present in the signal, while a larger modulus means that more of that frequency is present in the signal. This is particularly useful when analyzing sound signals, especially if trying to sort and denoise certain frequencies out of the signal. The FFT provides no information about where the frequencies occur in the signal, just how much is present For example, the two data sets shown in Figure 7 will have dierent Fourier transforms, but with the exact same power spectrum, shown in Figure 8. To combat this shortcoming, a windowed Fourier transform is used, but this in turn limits the frequencies that can be measured. Also, if the same data is added to a set of linear data, both the Fourier transform and its power spectrum will be radically 


dierent, as shown in Figure 9 Figure 7: Two digerent, but similar, data sets Figure 8: The power spectrum for both of the data sets in Figure 3 With wavelet analysis, the two data sets shown in Figure 7 will have completely dierent wavelet decompositions, with larger magnitude coecients in the location of the ?bump?. However, with the use of the correct basis \(namely, a basis with approximation order 2 or above in Figure 7 and the data shown at the top of Figure 9 will have exactly the same wavelet decomposition This property can be useful when trying to analyze data overlaid upon other background data 1.3 Wavelets vs. Multiwavelets The concept of a scaling function can be generalized to a vector of functions, called a scaling Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 vector. A scaling vector 1> = = = > !u a dilation equation of its own  s 2 X q5Z fq 2{ q 3 for some sequence of u  u matrices, and the entire set m\({ q 4 is a linearly independent set. Scaling vectors are said to be orthogonal if the sequence of matrices fq is nite and the components of satisfyZ R l q  1 when l = m, q = 0 0 otherwise Figure 9: The same data set with added linear data, and its power spectrum Scaling vectors still establish MRA?s, with the set given in \(4 structure, there will exist a vector of functions 1> = = = > #u 


plement of Y0 in Y1, denoted Z0, that will necessary satisfy its own dilation equation  s 2 X q5Z gq 2{ q 5 for some nite sequence of u  u matrices gq. As before, when using an orthogonal scaling vector, the matrix coecients can be used to construct perfectreconstruction lters for the decomposition and reconstruction of the signal in Y0 There are several advantages to using multiwavelets for analysis over single wavelets. The Haar scaling function dened in \(2 ure 1 is the only single scaling function to have any symmetry/anti-symmetry properties. However as we shall see in the next section, we may build scaling vectors such that each function in the vector has symmetry/anti-symmetry properties. Also each single scaling function ! must necessarily satisfy the condition thatZ R  This is not true for all of the functions in a scaling vector, but for only one of the functions. \(The antisymmetric members of the scaling vector would not satisfy this criteria, for example, so not all of the scaling vector functions could be anti-symmetric And lastly, for the class of scaling vectors that we will illustrate in this paper, it is very easy to build boundary functions and still maintain orthogonality. With the exception of the Haar basis, if you truncate a single scaling function supported on [d> e to a shorter integer-length interval, the function will no longer maintain its orthogonality to other truncated functions. The scaling vectors shown in Section 2, all of which are supported over an interval no larger than [1> 1], have the property that they are orthogonal \(or in the last basis shown, can be made orthogonal with a simple procedure both to the interval [1> 0] and [0> 1], meaning that the functions, when truncated at { = 0 and normalized, are still part of an orthogonal basis set on a bounded region Multiwavelets do have one disadvantage over the single wavelet constructions: the lters can not gen 


erally be applied directly to the raw data without losing approximation order. \(Much work has been done in creating balanced scaling vectors that can be applied directly to data. See [1], [7], and [8] for more details of the data, one has to rst convert the raw data to basis coecients in the Y0 space, called preltering, and if reconstructing the data, convert the basis coecients back into data, called postltering. Ideally, a prelter will preserve the o2-norm of the data called an ruwkrjrqdo prelter, as well as preserve the polynomial order of the data, but orthogonal prelters that preserve approximation order of the basis are sometimes hard to nd. \(They also have issues on bounded regions. See [5] for an excellent introduction to preltering nal prelter is more necessary in image compresProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 sion applications than in pattern recognition. We are able to use a relatively simple non-orthogonal prelter, called a quasi-interpolation prelter, that maps the data to basis coecients in Y0 so that the combination of basis functions interpolates data sampled from polynomials up to the approximation order of the basis, and comes close to interpolating non-polynomial data 2. Useful Bases There are a number of orthogonal multiwavelet bases that have been developed. \(See [9] and [10 for some other examples the ones presented here have the advantage of being easily applied to bounded data, but they also have another advantage. The following bases all generate spaces that contain spline spaces; that is, piecewise polynomial spaces over integer knots that meet certain match-up conditions at the integers. We use the notation Sug\(Z polynomials of degree g that have equal uth derivatives at integer knots, where the 0th derivative is understood to be the function value. Thus, while we will refer to the approximation order n of the following bases, it it important to realize that the Y0 space generated by the bases will also contain piecewise polynomials of degree n  1 that are either continuous at integer values, or in the case of the last basis, have one derivative at integer values 2.1 GHM Basis The GHM basis rst appeared in [3], and was re 


constructed from a macroelement perspective in [4 and are illustrated in Figure 10.

Hence, each approximation space, even at the lowest resolution will contain functions that have at least one nondierentiable ?corner?. This may not be desirable Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 especially if the points of interest in the original signal happen to fall on these corners at every resolution \(for example, at the midpoint of the data set basis \(i.e., has no corners A scaling vector was developed by the author in 6] that has approximation order 4, and generates a space that contains the spline space S13\(Z is, the space of piecewise cubic polynomials that are both continuous and dierentiable at the integer knots.

Pattern Matching The premise behind using wavelets for pattern matching is that the wavelet decomposition for the pattern for which you are searching and for the pattern added to data sampled from a polynomial of degree less than the approximation order of your scaling vector will be equal. For example, the wavelet decompositions for both data sets shown in Figure 16 will be identical when using either of the bases discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. It is necessary that the pattern not be in the lowest-resolution approximation space, so that it will not have a wavelet decomposition with only 0 coecients. This problem is rare, but if it occurs, it is remedied by either continuing the decomposition to an even lowerresolution space, or by using a dierent scaling vector of lower approximation order In most cases, the pattern will not be overlaid upon perfectly polynomial data, and so, the wavelet decompositions will not match exactly. However, if the pattern is prominent enough in the signal so that the root mean square error \(UPVH new decomposition {gl} when compared to the decomposition {gl } of the original pattern, as dened Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 by UPVH vuuuut QX l=1 gl  gl Q 


is suciently small, then the pattern will still be detected Figure 16: Pattern data \(top data obscured by cubic polynomial data bottom When using a single scaling function and wavelet are used in applications, each successively smoother approximation of the data stretches the support of the basis functions, eectively drawing more data from outside the region where the pattern actually occurs. By using the scaling vectors and multiwavelets mentioned in Section 2, we are able to analyze data on a bounded region, and ignore data outside of that region 3.1 When to Use Wavelets Wavelet decompositions can be used to nd patterns in any type of data, but there are no advantages to using them for exact pattern matching. For example, if searching for the word ?the? in a text le or in packet data, we have to search for the exact ASCII values 116, 104, and 101 in succession Changing those values, even by a constant amount changes the word. Also, to apply the wavelet bases mentioned in Section 2, we need 2q + 1 data values for some integer q A 1 for the DGM and the approximation-order-4 basis, and 2q+2 data values for some integer q A 1 for the basis in Section 2.3 so we would have to pad the target pattern with spaces. This type of search can be conducted much more eciently using other search methods, such as Bloom lters, etc However, for quantitative data like packet trac dependent upon time, multiwavelets have the potential to spot patterns that are not immediately noticable to the human eye, such as in the bottom graph of Figure 16. The following section gives an example of how multiwavelets can be used to detect a ?low and slow? pattern caused by data exltration 3.2 Trac Analysis Example Suppose that we have a corrupted computer and we are aware through previous experience that this particular piece of malevolent code tends to sneak? data out under the ?TCP? protocol in the following pattern a single packet of size 256 bytes, followed approximately 1 second later by another packet of size 512 bytes one second later, four packets of size 256 bytes are sent with a quarter second gap between 


the packets, and one quarter-second later, three packets of size 512 bytes are sent, followed one-quarter second later by one packet of size 256 bytes The accumulated bytes sent with respect to time in seconds are shown in Figure 17 Total Bytes Seconds Figure 17: Accumulated bytes for the example pattern The packets described above have been inserted into a set of network trac packet collected from the author?s laptop over roughly 4 minutes of usage starting at w = 240 seconds. The total accumulated outgoing bytes are illustrated in Figure 18. To apply the basis looking for this specic pattern, we Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 accumulate the bytes on quarter-second intervals and generate a wavelet decomposition for a sliding 4-second window, which is compared to the original pattern?s decomposition with the UPVH. The UPVH for the dierent starting times are shown in Figure 19. Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time Total Bytes Seconds Figure 18: Accumulated outgoing bytes of a sample usage period plus the packets in our pattern UPVH Seconds Figure 19: UPVH values \(less than 50 blocks of data with digerent starting times Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time In fairness, this method of nding patterns has many of the same weaknesses found in other signature-matching approaches. The pattern has to be known ahead of time, which means that this detection scheme would still be vulnerable to rst-time attacks. Also, a completely innocuous data ow occurring with very similiar timing and quantities as our pattern will still cause a low UPVH value, possibly causing a false-positive alert. We do claim 


however, that we have a greater capacity for nding patterns in quantiable amounts that are obscured by standard network trac. Also, we can adjust the sensitivity of the search without changing the signature for which we are searching, by adjusting the threshold of the UPVH?s for which an alert is issued. Thus, statistical techniques and adaptive learning can be used to help develop optimal threshold levels for a particular pattern 4. Conclusion Wavelet analysis holds an as-of-yet untapped potential for analyzing usage patterns in network trac ows, due to their ability to lter out data up to a given approximation order. Neither simple character searches nor Fourier analysis has this capability. Also, while Fourier analysis generally gives only frequency information within an analysis window, wavelet analysis gives some amount of both frequency information and the location of that frequency activity. The additional information comes at no additional computational costs, since the bases are generally applied by convolving matrix lters over the data \(repeated matrix multiplication over sliding blocks of data tiwavelet bases introduced in this document should prove to be particularly useful in pattern-matching applications, due to their short support \(that is, non-zero only over a small interval the inclusion of splines in the approximation spaces instead of just polynomials, and the ability to use them on time series with left and right boundaries The author is currently working with computer scientists at the CyberDefense Lab \(CDL at Western Kentucky University to develop software that will utilize these bases in network security, intrusion-detection, and data-extrusion applications. Once developed, we will study the eectiveness of this type of analysis in detecting malicious behavior as compared to the more commonly used techniques, with the hope of improving detection capabilities while maintaining a low false-positive rate. The software will initially be tested in the CDL?s sandbox while running attacks from its attack library with various background usage scripts being implemented, but will eventually move to less controlled network environments Acknowledments: This work supported in part by the NACMAST consortium under contract

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
