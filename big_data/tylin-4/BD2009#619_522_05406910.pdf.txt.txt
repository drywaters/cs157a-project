This new method not only guarantees a strong anti-1PEG-compression attack function, but also keeps the watermarked image away from obvious distortion. In the meanwhile, as a compensation for filtering attack, the watermark bits are also embedded into the high-frequency coefficients which have a big magnitude comparing with the maximum of the low-frequency coefficients in DWT. Finally the extracted watermark bits from low-frequency and highfrequency coefficients form the final extracted watermark The traditional watermark scrambling methods include Arnold Scrambling method[3], Magic Square Scrambling method and Hilbert Curve Scrambling method[4], etc. Here the Arnold Scrambling method is used to increase the ability of anti-cropping attack and the whole security before embedding lP EG-compression attack is obtained, but a big distortion in the watermarked image will appear with square effect. As shown in Table I, when the uniform embedded intensity is 0.04 and 0.05 the watermark is almost not influenced by the lP EGcompression attack with Quality Factor\(QF square distortion appears in the watermarked image TABL E I.

I N TRODUCTION Nowadays, the unauthorized pass-round and copy of digital mediums via the Internet become more and more serious as the rapid development of the Internet. One of the most effective solutions to protect the intellectual property rights is to apply digital watermark Currently, there are two most popular digital watermarking technologies including the Methods in Time Domain and Methods in Transformation Domain. Methods in the former one can be implemented more simply, but the robustness is poorer, while methods in the latter one are more popular with their stronger anti-attack functions. The typical Transformation-Domain Methods are mostly based on the domain of Discrete Fourier Transform \(DFT Transform \(DCT DWT Among them, the algorithms based on DWT[I][2] are in common use. In these kinds of methods, the information of watermark is inserted into the coefficients of intermediate-Iowfrequency in DWT domain. Although this may not cause an obvious quality distortion of the watermarked image, its 


obvious quality distortion of the watermarked image, its function against lPEG compression attack is not very ideal. If the information of watermark is inserted into low-frequency coefficients in DWT domain, then a strong function against Abstract-It is more likely to prevent the watermark from JPEG-compression attack, when it is emhedded into the lowfrequency coefficients of DWT. However, embedding the watermark with the same intensity into them may distort the watermarked image to a large extent. To solve this problem, a novel robust image-watermark algorithm is proposed with the characteristics of selective embedding intensity based on the nonuniform partition. Meanwhile, as a balance for filtering attacks the watermark bits arc also embedded into the high-frequency coefficients which have a big magnitude. Besides, in order to increase the anti-cropping function and the security of the algorithm, Arnold Scrambling Algorithm is applied before the watermark is embedded. The results of the experiments have showed that this algorithm is robust against noising attack filtering attack and cropping attack, especially the JPEGcompression attack and no obvious distortion appeared in the watermarked image 978-1-4244-4543-1/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE PElTS 2009 25 II. THE CALCULATION OF THE EMBEDDED INTENSITY BASED ON THE NON-UNIFORM RECTANGULAR PARTITION OF IMAGE Paper [4] proposed the algorithm of the non-uniform rectangular partition of image according to the pixel gray values. When the initial partition, the bivariate polynomial and the error control value are all determined, this adaptive partition algorithm can be applied to do the non-uniform rectangular partition of image. As an example, we choose 10,7,4 and 1, and the following figures show the partition results and the number of rectangles within each 8*8 sub-area of the image Figure 1. Partition results and the number of rectangles within each 8*8 subarea of the image when &amp; = 10 Figure 2.

Partition results and the number of rectangles within each 8*8 subarea of the image when =4 26 Figure 4. Partition results and the number of rectangles within each 8*8 subarea of the image when =1 The four groups of figures show that: if the error is too big the texture characteristics of image cannot be made out obviously; if it is too small, the number of rectangles in each 8*8 sub-area becomes almost 16. After many experiments, the texture characteristics of image for general images can be described in a good way, when the error is between 4 and 7 The smallest partition size is 2*2=4\(pixels number of rectangles in each 8*8 sub-area is 8*8/4=16, and the minimum number is one Here the Normalized Correlation Coefficient \(NC to scale the similarity between the original watermark and extracted watermark. The definition ofNC is given by I Where W\(x,y x,y extracted watermark In order to deduce the embedded intensity formula according to the rectangle number within each sub-area, the analysis is conducted between the watermarked image and extracted watermark after applying the uniform-intensity embedding in the coefficients of LL3 after three level wavelet decomposition as in Figure 5.

It is in opposite way while the uniform intensity is 0.06 In fact, this situation can be improved by the configuration of the different embedding intensity, according to the texture distribution of the image. Firstly , the host image \(M*N uniformly partitioned, the control error G is between 4 and 7 then the number of partitioned rectangles within each 8*8 subarea, according to the partition grids , is obtained.

After many experiments, we concluded that if the we set the threshold value as T=a*max{LLp}, a is between 0.01 and 0.04, and among the high-frequency coefficients HL],LH],HH], ... , HLp,LHp,HHp, we can find first L*L \(size of the watermark watermark bits.

In general, the PSNRs of the watermarked images are above 38dB and it is robust against nosing attack, filtering attack and cropping attack. The attack types are similar to those in paper [5] but the effect is better. In order to test the ability of anti-JPEG-compression attack of this algorithm, another kind of experiment \(jJ is also 0.01 in table IV. Table IV shows the performance between this algorithm and paper [5] after JPEG-compression attack with different QF. The BERs of the recovered watermarks are smaller and generally below 0.02 and the corresponding NC values are always greater than 0.98 for QF ~25. This proves that this algorithm is very robust against JPEG-compression attack. The whole anti-attack performance of this algorithm is effective without obvious distortion in the watermarked image The value of fJ can be chosen according to the real situation by user thus enhancing the feasibility of this algorithm 28 TABLE IV.

CONCLUSION Image can be partitioned into different sub-rectangles with different texture characteristics by the algorithm of adaptive non-uniform rectangular partition. This paper proposes a new non-uniform intensity embedding method according to the number of partitioned rectangles in each sub-area after the above partition is performed. The embedding position is the low-frequency coefficients of DWT thus improving the antiJPEG-compression attack function of the watermarking. The watermark bits are also uniformly embedded into the highfrequency coefficients with a big magnitude comparing with the maximum value of low-frequency coefficient thus further improving the anti-filtering function. After the test of some general attacks, the experimental results prove that the proposed watermarking algorithm is feasible and effective, the whole anti-attack function is satisfactory and the anti-JPEGcompression function is strong ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by NSF-CHINA Project No. I063I080 grant \(No.2004CB 318000 Development Fund of Macao SAR \(No.008/2008/A1 REFERENCES I] YANG Heng-Fu, CHEN Xiao-Wei .

6.3. Evaluation of query performance on compressed data  In order to evaluate the query performance on compressed data, we have compared the query evaluation on KST signature with two other approaches. On the one hand, we have compared it with JAXP, the standard XPath evaluator contained in Java 1.5 in order to compare the overall query performance. On the other hand, we have compared it with our generic query evaluation engine working on uncompressed SAX events and using the same elementary navigation operations first-child and nextsibling and the same framework on top to evaluate queries, in order to evaluate the effect of compression on the query evaluation time Our test data set was generated by the XML generator of the XML Benchmark XMark [14 u s i n g a  scaling factor of 0.001 \(116 kB\p to 0.128 \(14.5 MB On our dataset, we have evaluated queries of the XPath benchmark XPathMark-A h e tes t qu erie s  can be seen in Table 2  Table 2.

Except for the queries Q2 and Q4, KST signature performs better than JAXP and performs comparable to our generic query evaluation engine working on the uncompressed XML data. KST signature needs a longer evaluation time than the other approaches for the queries Q2 and Q4, as the descendant-axis location step in these queries requires that the whole sub-tree under the current context node has to be searched and thus partially decompressed. As KST signature was designed for optimal compression an index for descendants has not been included  Q2 0 2000 4000 6000 050100150 ms KST signature JAXP Uncompressed Figure 8.

7. Summary and conclusions  We have presented a technique for lossless data reduction of huge XML files and XML data streams Our data reduction technique combines KST signature compression with structure sharing known from DAGs in the following way We introduce the concept of explicit XML nodes that can be used as pointer origin and still allow for unique decompression and fast query evaluation Furthermore, we encode pointer destinations by SAX event numbers of previous XML nodes We have integrated the concept of pointer to substructures with the KST signature that can be generated by parsing the XML document with an attribute grammar that uses the DTD. A special feature of the compression and the attribute grammar rule is that the same DTD rule set can be used for decompressing the KST signature. Query processing avoids full decompression and uses partial decompression on demand, e.g. for answer sub-tree generation We have reduced query processing to a set of elementary navigation operations, consisting of firstchild, next-sibling, parent and label, and we have developed fast query evaluation on top of these elementary operations. To support following pointers and backward navigation, we keep the child path from the root to the current context node on further information on a stack. This supports efficient query evaluation on our compressed data format KST signature without the requirement of expensive decompression Finally, we have conducted extensive performance evaluations that show that our approach not only results in reasonable query evaluation times, but also outperforms the compression ratios of all the other compression techniques, including even nonqueryable compression techniques like gzip, XMill and BZip2 Altogether, our approach reduces huge XML data structures or XML data streams to a significantly smaller KST signature. It combines a scalable and significant size reduction of verbose XML structures with a comparably fast query processing technique Therefore, the use of KST signature is a significant step towards XML data reduction and the management of huge XML files and streams 8.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
