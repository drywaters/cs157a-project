INTRODUCTION Near Earth Objects \(NEOs past decade due to the danger they present to our planet NEOs vary greatly in size and the dangers they represent are directly related to their size. The dangers these objects pose prompted NASA to form a NEO Science Definition Team This team produced a report on August 22, 2003 that described and quantified the impact these NEOs would have on Earth and its populace. The report called for cataloguing 90% of NEOs over 140 meters in size. Part of this recommendation was carried out in the form of the Spaceguard project. The Spaceguard project searches for NEOs above 1 kilometer \(km considered extinction events. This search is nearly complete 1 1 U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright 2 IEEEAC paper #1581, Version 5, Updated October 30, 2008 at the time of this paper  s submission [1 Although they may not be globally catastrophic, NEOs smaller than 1 km in diameter can cause massive regional damage such as the Tunguska air blast event of 1908 estimated to be 50-100 meters in diameter. These smaller, &lt 1km, NEOs are more numerous than the larger, &gt; 1km NEOs and create more difficult detection issues. Due to their smaller size, their visual magnitudes should be larger making them harder to detect. Being more numerous and harder to detect than larger NEOs, it may be necessary to make more scans of the sky than were necessary for the Spaceguard project In order to address these issues, it is necessary to readdress detection techniques. Several techniques have been described in other research infrared satellites, space-based optical telescopes, and large \(greater than 1 meter based optical telescopes. Most of these have costs in the tens or hundreds of millions and use standard threshold 


tens or hundreds of millions and use standard threshold techniques [2, 3 In this paper, a matched filter technique is described for using ground-based telescopes to detect NEOs and MatLab code is used to simulate this process 2. BACKGROUND Spaceguard The search for large NEOs has been conducted using both space and ground based large telescopes \(greater than 1 m in diameter then Nyquist thereby creating aliasing.  They use diffraction limited resolution which is referred to as Rayleigh resolution. This aliasing allows them to typically collect the majority of the photons from the NEO into one pixel and therefore by-pass the effects of the atmospheric seeing Aliasing does increase the pixel background and the noise per pixel. With most of the photons in one pixel, no filter is necessary and a straight-forward threshold detector can be used. The NEO Report uses a threshold of 6 standard deviations of the background noise or a signal-to-noise ratio SNR  2 Atmospheric Seeing Light from NEOs reach our atmosphere and are obscured and spread by turbulence in the layers of our atmosphere This turbulence results in the photons from the NEOs spread out spatially. This spatial spread decreases the resolution possible. The resulting shape of the image is changed from a point source to a circular image whose size is dependent on the turbulence in the atmosphere. The intensity of the image decreases with distance from the center of the image. The turbulence is parameterized by the seeing parameter, r0 Different locations have different atmospheric seeing values and those values change over the course of time during the day and night. Locations with higher altitudes tend to have better atmospheric seeing parameters. The atmospheric seeing parameter can have values of 1 to 20 cm. Satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope, are not hindered by atmospheric seeing and therefore have better resolution but costs are dramatically increased over ground-based telescopes Point Spread Function \(PSF The turbulence affect described above results in the NEO  s point source being spread in to a circular shape. This is referred to as the point spread function \(psf determined either by the telescope diameter or the atmospheric seeing parameter, which ever aperature is smallest. The photons from the NEO are distributed by this psf. Since the diameter of the telescope is known and r0 can be measured at the time of data collection, the psf can be calculated In a best case scenario, the NEO will be in the center of a pixel in the ccd and create the images shown below in Figure 1, Rayleigh resolution, and Figure 2, Nyquist resolution, which will be described in detail in Section 3 The photon distribution is greater in the Nyquist image due to its greater resolution which means fewer photons per pixel but a better defined psf For the best case scenario, the number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Rayleigh psf is 61 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 15 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 75 percent The number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Nyquist psf is 19 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 2.5 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 34 percent  Figure 1  Rayleigh resolution PSF with seeing of 14 cm 


Figure 1  Rayleigh resolution PSF with seeing of 14 cm with source in center of pixel \(65, 65  Figure 2  Nyquist resolution PSF with seeing of 14 cm with source in center of pixel \(65, 65 In the worst case scenario, the NEO will be in the corner of a pixel and therefore distribute its photons equally among four pixels and create a much broader psf. Figure 3 Rayleigh resolution, and Figure 4, Nyquist resolution, show the resulting images from the psf. The Nyquist resolution shows a better defined psf in this case also For the worst case scenario, the number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Rayleigh psf is 30 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 11 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 34 percent The number of photons concentrated in one pixel of the Nyquist psf is 14 percent for a seeing of 14. For a seeing parameter of 5 cm, the photon concentration decreases to 2.4 percent. For a seeing parameter of 20 cm, the percentage increases to 20.5 percent  3  Figure 3  Rayleigh resolution PSF with seeing of 14 cm with source in upper corner of pixel \(65, 65  Figure 4  Nyquist resolution PSF with seeing of 14 cm with source in upper corner of pixel \(65, 65 The psf can be used as a filter to help bring the NEO out in the image. This is possible by using the psf and a calculated estimate of the photon intensity of the object you are looking for. For NEO searches, the appropriate photon intensity should be from a 140 meter NEO since that is the limiting diameter we are looking for and larger NEOs will be easier to detect. The distance to the NEO is a more difficult assumption. This calculated psf is then correlated against the ccd image from the telescope. The result will be an image where the source is preserved but the surrounding background noise is reduced since the background noise will not correlate well with the psf. This will make it possible to detect dimmer NEOs then previously possible 3. PROCEDURE The MatLab computational language was used to simulate the data and perform the algorithms to test the correlation hypothesis The telescope diameter, d, used for these simulations was 1 meter with an area of .785 square meters. An integration time of 1 second is standard for all data sets. 100 background images and 100 images with a NEO source present were generated for each data set for statistical purposes. The number of images was kept lower to allow faster computation A ccd rectangular grid with 128-by-128 pixels was used for all simulations. The quantum efficiency of the ccd is 66 percent to agree with NEO report simulations. Also, a detection limitation of SNR 6 is used for comparison purposes to the NEO report [1 Cutoff frequency, fc, is given by \(1.1 wavelength of visible light, d is the diameter of the telescope, and zi is the number of pixels across the telescope plane c i df z??  \(1 The Nyquist resolution, fs, is defined as 2 times the cutoff frequency  2 s 


s i df z??  \(2 Atmospheric seeing can limit the resolution possible by the telescope. If the diameter of the telescope is greater than the seeing parameter, r0, the seeing parameter replaces the diameter in the Nyquist equation  2 0 c i rf z??  \(3 The inverse of \(1.3  2 0 iz r 4 The individual pixel angle, ??, which is used for this paper  s approach, is defined \(1.5  2 0r 5 The pixel angle used in the NEO report is given below  1.22 0r 6 The difference in pixel angle between the two resolutions 4 results in more photons from the NEO being contained in fewer pixels for \(6 5 also means more background photons will be collected in the Rayleigh resolution pixels than for Nyquist resolution To compute the number of photons reaching the telescope from the NEO, a visual magnitude approach was used. The baseline for a zero magnitude object is Vega. Vega  s temperature, 9602 Kelvin, was used to compute the luminosity of the star along with quantizing the visible wave numbers into discrete increments of 1 centimeter from 10000/.7 to 10000/.4, visual band used for these simulations  2 3200 1b hc k T hcL e     7 In Eq. 7, T is the temperature of the star, h is Plank  s constant, kb is Boltzmann  s constant, ? is the wave number and c is the speed of light. The power for each discrete photon packet is computed by multiplying the luminosity of each packet by the surface area of Vega The power is then spread over the surface area of a sphere with the radius of the distance from Earth to Vega. This is the flux that is incident on the 1 meter telescope. The flux is multiplied by the area of the telescope lens, .785 square meters, to find the incident power The incident power of each discreet packet is divided by the specific power necessary for a photon at that wavelength  1energy ch 


ch 8 With the number of photons in each packet computed, they are summed together to find the total number of photons in the visible band received from Vega. To calculate the number of photons from a NEO with a specific visual magnitude baseline zero Vega by the following equation  2.512 photons  9 The same equation is used to calculate the number of photons for the background with a particular visual magnitude The photon number from the NEO is multiplied by the integration time of the exposure. This value is used along with the seeing parameter, r0, the pixel resolution, dx, and the ccd size to create a point spread function. The resulting psf will be a 128-by-128 matrix which represents the ccd The background is created by taking the number of photons calculated from \(2 then dividing it by the total number of pixels in the ccd and adding it to each entry in a 128-by-128 matrix that represents the ccd. Due to the pixel angle difference between the two approaches, the Rayleigh resolution will have a background visual magnitude of 19.5 while the Nyquist resolution will have a background visual magnitude of 21.5 The image is created by adding each corresponding entry from the two matrixes together. Noise is introduced by using the  poissrnd  function in MatLab to produce a poisson random variable noise to the data The background per pixel value calculated earlier is now subtracted from the image and the background image To perform the correlation, the Fast Fourier Transform FFT FFT of the psf is multiplied by the complex conjugate the FFT of the image. The FFT of the psf is also multiplied by the complex conjugate    10 The psf used for correlation is created with the NEO source in the center of a pixel unless otherwise stated in the Results Section or in the figure caption. This is regardless of the position of the NEO source used in the creation of the image Using these two correlated matrixes, the image and background, a threshold detection technique can be used to determine if a signal is present. First, the standard deviation of the background must be calculated using the values from the correlated background matrix and the mean of that matrix. With this, the value of the SNR 6 can be computed by multiplying the standard deviation of the correlated background matrix by 6. This value is the threshold for the threshold detector The threshold detector works by comparing each value in both the correlated image and background to the threshold value. Any value above the threshold value is considered a detection. This is considered a positive recognition of a source, the NEO. If the detection is in the background, it is a false alarm and is cataloged as such. If the detection occurs in the image, it is a positive alarm and is cataloged as such At an SNR 6, the theoretical false alarm rate for each pixel with the matrix is 9.866x10^-10, calculated by \(11  2 6 2 0 


2.5 - dt 2 te  11 5 The false alarm rate for the 100 background 128-by-128 matrixes is .001616. This is important to note for comparison versus the simulated false alarm rates given in the Results Section. The theoretical and simulated false alarm rates should be similar An acceptable positive alarm rate is considered to be 90 and above as is stated in the NEO report [1 4. RESULTS Two data sets were simulated for the Rayleigh resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 19.5 visual magnitude. One with correlation, one without correlation, and both with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 5  Figure 5  Rayleigh resolution with and without correlation for a source located in the center of pixel The data shows that psf correlation with Rayleigh resolution has some benefit at higher SNRs and is well above the 90 discovery rate specified in the NEO report. The correlation technique gives it  s best improvement as the SNR increases to 6 where it gives close to a 10 percent increase in detection probability Two data sets were simulated for the Nyquist resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 21.5 visual magnitude. One with correlation, one without correlation and both with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 6  Figure 6  Nyquist resolution with and without correlation for a source located in the center of pixel When Nyquist resolution is used, it is evident from the data that correlation with the psf is necessary to increase the detection rate to just above 70 percent at SNR 6. The detection probability increases to over 90 percent by SNR 5 and reaches 100 percent by SNR 4 Without correlation, using Nyquist causes close to a 40 loss of detection capability when compared to the Rayleigh resolution detection in figure 5. With correlation, the Nyquist resolution detection is less than 10% lower then Rayleigh resolution detection from figure 5 at SNR 6. By SNR 5, the psf correlation of the Nyquist resolution has a higher detection probability then the uncorrelated Rayleigh resolution in figure 5 and continues to have a higher detection probability to SNR 3 Three data sets for the Rayleigh resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 19.5 visual magnitude One with correlation, one without correlation, one with correlation from a psf with the source in the corner of the pixel, and all with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 7  6  Figure 7  Rayleigh resolution without and with correlation of psf in corner and center of pixel with source in corner of pixel The data shows that correlation with a psf from a center pixel aligned does not improve the detection probability Correlation with a correctly aligned psf does increase the detection probability as shown by the top data line Two data sets were simulated for the Nyquist resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude with a background of 21.5 visual magnitude. One with and one without correlation and both with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values 


with a seeing value of 14 cm for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 is shown in figure 8  Figure 8  Nyquist with correlation versus Nyquist without correlation for a source in corner of pixel The data shows that a correlation improves detection probability at all SNRs from 6 to 3. The point where the two lines cross is at different SNRs When compared to figure 7, the psf correlated Nyquist resolution detection probability is greater than the Rayleigh resolution threshold detection at all SNRs. As the SNR increase the improvement over the Rayleigh resolution threshold detection increase. At SNR 3, Nyquist resolution detection probability is 100 percent and Rayleigh resolution detection is 80 percent. At SNR 6, Nyquist resolution detection probability is 40 percent and Rayleigh resolution detection is 0 percent Two data sets are shown in figure 9, one with the Nyquist resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude NEO with a background of 21.5 visual magnitude with correlation, and the other has Rayleigh resolution for a 20.7 visual magnitude NEO with a background of 19.5 visual magnitude without correlation. A seeing value of 10 cm and telescope optics set for a seeing value of 14 cm. for a threshold of values ranging from SNR 3 to SNR 6 was used for both sets of data  Figure 9  Nyquist resolution correlated with a psf using a seeing parameter of 10 cm. and Rayeigh resolution for a seeing of 10 cm. with telescope optics parameter of 14 cm The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation, when nonoptimal telescope parameters are used, shows an improvement over Rayleigh resolution with only threshold detection Figure 10 shows two data sets for a center pixel NEO with a visual magnitude of 20.7. The Rayleigh resolution plot uses a background of 19.5 and the Nyquist resolution plot uses a background of 21.5. The Rayleigh resolution without correlation shows a trend of improvement with increase in atmospheric seeing parameter. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation also shows a trend of improvement with increase in atmospheric seeing parameter. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation does out perform the Rayleigh resolution without psf correlation for all seeing values. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation is a 2.5 times improvement on detection probability at a seeing value of 10 cm. At a seeing value of 20 cm., Nyquist resolution with correlation is still a 25% improvement over 7 Rayleigh resolution without correlation  Figure 10  Varying seeing effect on Nyquist resolution with correlation and Rayleigh resolution for source in center of pixel Figure 11 shows two data sets for a NEO in the corner of a pixel with a visual magnitude of 20.7. The Rayleigh resolution plot uses a background of 19.5 and the Nyquist resolution plot uses a background of 21.5. The Rayleigh resolution without correlation shows zero detection rate below a seeing of 15 cm while above 15 cm, the detection rate is less than 10 percent. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation shows a trend of improvement with increase in atmospheric seeing parameter with a detection rate of 75 percent at a seeing of 20 cm. The Nyquist resolution with psf correlation does out perform the Rayleigh resolution without psf correlation for all seeing values for a NEO in the corner of a pixel  Figure 11  Varying seeing effect on Nyquist resolution with correlation and Rayleigh resolution for source in 


with correlation and Rayleigh resolution for source in corner of pixel 5. CONCLUSIONS The psf correlation technique while only slightly better then the threshold detector in the best case scenario, NEO in center of pixel, is a great improvement over the threshold detector in more difficult scenarios such as NEO close to edge of a pixel and telescope optics not properly aligned for correct seeing at time of data collection These factors make ground-based telescopes a viable option for detecting NEOs of 140 meters and larger by incorporating the psf correlation technique at Nyquist resolution; thereby, saving money versus using expensive space-based telescopes. Also, ground-based telescopes are more numerous and multiple ground-based telescopes can scan more sky than one space-based telescope. Multiple ground-based sites can be used for statistical purposes of improving asteroid detection [4]. Multiple ground-based images can be averaged to reduce the background noise thereby, increases detection probability. Also, space-based telescopes are more difficult to acquire time, so groundbased telescopes are a more viable option for NEO detection Space telescopes incur significant costs and expensive maintenance and can have long down times waiting for maintenance. If the correlation process described in this paper were used for ground-based telescopes, cost-savings could be significant while detection capabilities would only be slightly impacted The NEO report uses Rayleigh resolution in order to increase the number of NEO photons within one pixel to increase detection probability using a threshold detector The psf correlation process uses the Nyquist resolution to allow for better definition of the psf within the image. This spreads the NEO photons over more pixels, but the psf correlation process allows for better detection than the NEO report process For ground-based telescopes, elevation is important for the best seeing parameters as mentioned in Section 2. Using the psf correlation can limit the impact of lower elevations on the detection capabilities of a telescope, but not eliminate the detriment of lower elevation. It is still in the best interest of NEO detection to use the highest elevations possible with the best seeing parameters, but where cost prohibits the acquisition of higher elevation this process can help limit the impact The false alarm rate is minimal at SNR 6 as was computed in by equation \(11 the false alarm rate only slightly and the increase in detection capability will greatly outweigh the false alarm rate increase. Figures 5 through 8 show a great improvement from SNR 6, the far left of each graph, to SNR 5. The improvement is typically 2 times better detection probability. The psf correlation process improves 8 the detection capabilities for NEOs. The psf correlation process exceeds the NEO reports requirement of 90 detection of NEOs with a visual magnitude of 20.7. It could also detect a majority of NEOs over 50 meters The psf correlation process will require significant computational time and resources. This can be overcome by segmenting the images to be correlated and distributing them to several processers. This is a significant difference between the psf correlation process and the standard threshold detection process used today. The computational intensity of this process can be handled by most mainframes Movement of the NEO within the image from pixel to pixel during exposure is an issue for both the NEO report process and the process described in this paper. Integration must be long enough to allow for enough photons for detection, but 


long enough to allow for enough photons for detection, but not so long as to allow the NEO to move into another pixel thereby distributing it  s photons into more pixels while the background intensity increases 6. CONCLUSION Nyquist resolution with psf correlation has been shown to be less affected by the atmospheric seeing parameter than just using a threshold detector alone. Using a psf correlation technique for Nyquist resolution images has been shown to increase the probability to discover NEOs over the current aliasing and threshold technique in all situations addressed in this paper ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The opinions and views expressed by the authors are not necessarily those of the Department of Defense or the United States Air Force REFERENCES 1] Near-Earth Object Science Definition Team, Study to Determine the Feasibility of Extending the Search for Near-Earth Objects to Smaller Limiting Diameters August 22, 2003 2] E.

Figure 15  ISM Data Flow serializer highlighted in yellow the design to ensure the clock-to-outputs of the individual serial signals were all matched indicating that at least on chip the design had no skew Finally we used a test bed layout with HyperLynx to prove that our part to part latencies were within acceptable ranges given the high design speed FPGA Design Rate The FPGA design used to verify the design speed was a relatively simple 8-bit latch and shift register shown in Figure 14 Figure 14 shows that the base clock is twice as fast as the output clock which is meant to simulate a recovered clock This is not necessarily a design requirement but would be necessary if the telemetry clock were an input to the design as was the case on the WISE mission This implies that the maximum frequency given by the timing tool for the design is twice the output clock Figure 14 shows only an 8-bit shift register but naturally depending on how the memory was organized more might be required The more bits used in the shift register the more internal clock skew slows the design If a wider bus were required it would be better to increase the depth of the input registers to maintain a high-speed design as opposed to increasing the number of output shift registers The results of this test were a maximum device clock speed of 336.7 MHz double data rate and a maximum output clock speed of 168.35 MHz in the Actel RTAX2000S as given by Actel Timing Designer This meets our requirement of 150 MHz on the clock signal with a margin of 12 FPGA Design Skew Using this same prototype design and mapping the outputs to physical pins we ensured the pin-to-pin skew was matched This skew is the amount of time it takes the edge to propagate from the internal logic to the physical pin on the part The results were as follows Path 1 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 2 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK N Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 3 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 4 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA N Clock to Out ns 7.014 The clock-to-output skews are all matched indicating the clock and data signals leave the part simultaneously and no delay is caused by mismatched skew Board Latency Simulation After a preliminary board layout was completed board simulations were performed on the signals from the FPGA to the LVDS repeater and ultimately to the front panel as shown in Figure 16 All of these simulations were performed in HyperLynx Boardsim 8.0 with manufacturer-provided IBIS models for the Integrated Circuits ICs The waveform given in Figure 17 is captured at the FPGA Figure 16  ISM Data Flow buffer highlighted in yellow Figure 17  FPGA LVDS output waveform simulations green/red  single-ended clock at FPGA blue  differential clock at destination The HyperLynx simulation was performed using a signal switching speed of 180 MHz to ensure adequate margin for the desired signal frequencies The rise times given in Table 9 are roughly one-tenth the simulated signal period 5.5 ns at 180 Mhz indicating they will not impede the switching frequency by slowing the time to the threshold voltage at the receiver The simulated scope shots for these signals indicate crisp edges and transitions The receiving part is an LVDS bus repeater meant to protect the radiation-hardened FPGA from any front-panel transients that might inadvertently occur during testing At the input to the repeater the simulated signal waveform is given in Figure 18 The transition regions for LVDS are shown as blue lines in Figure 18 While there is a considerable amount of overshoot 11 


Figure 18  LVDS signals at buffer input difference shown and re\003ections on the signal line from the repeater the transition region of the signal is very clean even simulated at 180 MHz This will easily meet our 150 MHz frequency requirement Signal characteristics are tabulated in Table 9 Signal Rise Time ps Fall Time ps Undershoot mV Overshoot mV Margin mV CLK 729.0 698.4 212 250 288 CLK903.1 685.4 256 150 244 DATA 738.9 702.8 216 250 284 DATA876.4 717.8 256 150 244 Table 9  FPGA LVDS output signal characteristics In addition to signal characteristics and waveforms the signal-to-signal skew was measured at the buffer input Obviously these values should be as small as possible to prevent modifying the board Like most differential signaling modes LVDS requires matched impedance signal pairs to function optimally HyperLynx was used to 002ne tune the termination on each differential pair and to match all of the trace impedances to this termination The skew was minimal Table 10 First LVDS Signal Second LVDS Signal Receiving Rise Skew ps Receiving Fall Skew ps CLK DATA 58.32 50.54 Table 10  LVDS rising and falling skew measured at receiver The Receiving Rise and Fall skews are the values for skew between the two signals as each signal passes the LVDS threshold voltage measured at the FPGA The time difference between these two crossings is the number shown in Table 10 Rise skew is measured on the rising edge and fall skew is measured on the falling edge as illustrated in Figure 19 Figure 19  LVDS receiver slew measurement Given that these skews were measured at 180 MHz skew between signals at 150 MHz will not inhibit data transfer by allowing the clock and data lines to get out of sync 6 C ONCLUSIONS It is clear that there are many places where timing is of great concern in the ISM data 003ow The initial data input is driven by the instrument interface timing the bandwidth of the FPGA FIFO buffers the speed of the formatter FPGA and the bandwidth of write accesses to the 003ash-memory The transmitter side of the data 003ow is dependent on the bandwidth of the read accesses to the 003ash-memory the FPGA FIFO buffer bandwidth the FPGA serializer frequency and the physical signal characteristics of the FPGA to the frontpanel interface A table summarizing all of these bandwidths in the order they occur in the data 003ow is presented in Table 11 Data Flow Block Bandwidth Units INSTRUMENT INPUT FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps Formatter FPGA Bandwidth 328 Mbps Flash-memory Write Bandwidth 104 Mbps TRANSMITTER OUTPUT Flash-memory Read Bandwidth 866 Mbps FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps FPGA Serializer Bandwidth 168 Mbps Table 11  Bandwidth summary In order to support our study signal integrity analysis was performed on the portions of the data 003ow affected by physical delays including into and out of the 003ash-memory and from the FPGA to the front panel These physical interfaces are robust enough to support high data throughput rates The ISM is capable of interfacing to an instrument with up to 104 Mbps of continuous data throughput and is capable of 12 


sourcing data to a transmitter at a bandwidth up to 168 Mbps This allows data to be stored to the ISM during the orbital encounter period and downlinked periodically as communications are available R EFERENCES  223R T AX-S/SL RadT olerant FPGAs 224 Actel Corporation Mountain View CA 2008 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/products/milaero/rtaxs/docs.aspx  223Prototyping R T AX-S Using Axcelerator Devices,\224 2003 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/techdocs/appnotes/rtaxs.aspx  223K9XXG08XXM Datasheet 2G x 8 Bit  4G x 8 Bit  8G x 8 Bit NAND Flash Memory,\224 Samsung Electronics 2007  223UT54A CS164245S/SE Schmitt CMOS 16-bit Bidirectional MultiPurpose Transceiver Datasheet,\224 Aero\003ex Corporation Colorado Springs CO 2009 Available http://aero\003ex.com/ams/pagesproduct/prodshirel-16bitlogic.cfm B IOGRAPHY  John Dickinson is a Research Engineer at Southwest Research Institute Having studied Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with a focus on control systems and signals he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division He was the lead Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for the WISE and Kepler Mission Unique Boards MUB for which he compiled and integrated the GSE hardware developed the test scripts and wrote and veri\002ed the GSE code He is the Lead Engineer for the JUNO JADE Instrument Processor Board a lowpower RAD-HARD 3U Compact PCI single-board computer that utilizes the Atmel LEON2 SPARC v8 processor and provides direct instrument and spacecraft serial interfaces He has supported integration systems engineering and promotional efforts on a variety of programs and is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology Charlie Howard  a Principal Engineer in the Department of Space Systems at Southwest Research Institute excels as system architect and digital designer with particular expertise in FPGA and ASIC design Mr Howard has 002lled an active role in the hardware/software architecture for the MMS Mass Memory Module MMM and is the designer of the Mass Memory Controller FPGA Mr Howard is the architect and designer of WISE Mission Unique Board MUB the Kepler Command and Telemetry Board CTB and the Orbital Express CTB and provided multiple FPGA designs for OE Kepler WISE and MMS As Kepler CTB lead he incorporated new simulation capabilities allowing the customer to verify advanced features of the Kepler CTB prior to delivery As an ASIC and FPGA designer Mr Howard 002lled roles in RTL design functional and gate level veri\002cation for high reliability systems including space telecom and defense applications His other interests are worst-case timing and signal integrity analyses Steven Torno is an Electrical Engineer at Southwest Research Institute He studied Electrical Engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute for Technology with a focus on digital signal processing and he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division in 2009 He was the Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for a Control and Telemetry Board CTB demo in partnership with ATK Space Systems where he integrated existing GSE hardware with custom test software he wrote and veri\002ed He is currently an Electrical Engineer for the Robotic Lander Test Bed project working on the Low Voltage Power Supply LVPS board He is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio 13

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
