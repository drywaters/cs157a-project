Conventional generation can obtain capacity credit because they can produce  firm  power during the peak load demand time when utilities are especially concerned about the wind power availability. As wind power is intermittent it is normally given zero or small capacity credit. In this paper, the wind availability and capacity credit for multiple wind farms distributed in Wyoming are analyzed based on actual wind data Considering multiple wind farms as part of one big wind farm distributed over a large area can decrease the wind power variation and increase the capacity credits. As the method used here to calculate capacity credit is the same one used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good  Index Terms-- Capacity credit for wind, wind power availability, wind power correlation and variation I.  INTRODUCTION HE strength and duration of wind are location dependent The installed power capacity of a single wind farm ranges from a few MW to thousands of MW. Fig. 1 shows the percentage of the installed wind power in the U.S. from 1996 to 2007 [1][2   Fig. 1 Percentage of installed wind power in the U.S  Wind power is an intermittent resource which varies continuously. The main concern about wind power is that there is not enough spinning reserve in the system when wind stop blowing, which may result in black out in high wind power penetration cases  Y.

Ula is with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA \(e-mail: ulas@uwyo.edu Wind energy can provide a part of the electrical demand but consumer cannot rely completely on wind powered electric energy because it is not available all the time Conventional generators, such as coal-fired and hydro plants have nominal ratings and their operational output can move between minimum and maximum rating freely. However wind turbines are different from them because input wind speed is not controllable as steam or water flow. The output of wind turbines follow the wind speed when the wind speed is between the cut-in and nominal speed of the wind turbines Therefore more reserve capacity is needed when more wind turbines are integrated into the power system. Reference [3 reviewed some analytic and utility case studies cases on the impacts of wind power on existing power systems. There was not a definite conclusion given in [3], however, it showed that the integration costs increases with size as integrating wind power requires more reserve. The cost becomes more with higher penetration The availability of wind power during peak load demand hours is of more concern to the system operators than that of the off-peak hours. The load demand curves were drawn using MISO  s hourly actual load in Fig.2 [4]. It shows a typical summer daily load curve of Midwest Independent System Operation \(MISO increases during the morning hours and reaches the peak in the afternoon at about 4pm as indicated by  A  in Fig.2. It is worth noting that during morning hours shown as  B  or late night hours shown as  C  the operating utilities have plenty of surplus generation available to take care of any reduction in wind generation. This is because of the fact that the utilities are prepared, based on their day-ahead or week-ahead 


generation scheduling, to satisfy this day  s peak demand of  A  During the peak demand time, more generation resources are needed to balance the load demand and the system reserve requirements for contingencies. All the units are processed into service during these times including very high incremental cost peaking units. Therefore, much availability of wind power during the peak demand time is more valuable than at other times. As a result, the utilities award capacity credit for the firm output of generation resources which they can use at peak hours. However, wind power is intermittent and awarded zero or very small capacity credit by the utilities It is extremely valuable financially for the wind farms to increase their capacity credit Estimation of Wind Power Availability and Capacity Credit for Multiple Wind Farms Yi Zhang, Student Member, IEEE, and Sadrul Ula, Senior Member, IEEE T 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 Po w er G W  Hour Fig. 2 Hourly load demand of MISO on July 18, 2007  This paper discusses the wind power availability and variation between individual wind farms location and their combination. Finally, the capacity credit is calculated separately for each location and their combination and the increase in the extremely valuable capacity credit awarded to two isolated wind farms compared to their combined effect is quantified. The difference of capacity credit rewarded between individual wind farms and multiple wind farm combinations are also presented II.  WIND DATA ACQUISITION One of the major challenges of wind power availability analysis is the lack of reliable wind data. Over the last four years, the University of Wyoming Electric Motor Training &amp Testing Center has installed more than 30 wind measurement towers in the state of Wyoming and Nebraska. They covered a very large area of eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska The locations used for this study are shown in Fig. 3. The distance between two locations is 300 km. The data were collected from April 1st, 2006 to March 31st, 2009. The data include the wind speeds at 60 meters, 50 meters, and 40 meters, the wind directions at 60 meters and 50 meters, and the temperatures at ground level. The quality of wind data captured by the data loggers used in this paper is over 98 good. The data were averaged and recorded by the data loggers every 10 minutes. The time of data loggers at different locations were set via cell phones and watches. The time error of each location is estimated to be 1 or 2 minutes. The mean wind speed in summer \(May 1 to October 31 November 1 to April 30 each location are shown in Table I  TABLE I WIND DATA AND POTENTIAL CAPACITY

WIND POWER AVAILABILITY For this study, let us assume no scheduled outage or maintenance in the wind farms. The generation only depends on the local wind speed, i.e., the wind turbines will produce electricity if wind speed is between the wind turbines  cut-in and cut-out speeds. The output of wind turbines will follow their power curves. The wind turbines used in this paper are GE 1.5XLE and its power curve is shown in [5]. Its cut-in rated and cut-out speeds are 3.5 m/s, 14 m/s and 25 m/s respectively [5 10 minute average wind speeds for four days of summer and winter are plotted from raw data and shown in Fig. 4 From the 10 minute average wind speeds of all locations, it can be found that the wind speeds of the two locations are seldom below the cut-in speed \(about 3.5 m/s to 4 m/s above the cut-out speed \(25 m/s words, these locations are able to partly compensate each other  s no wind condition due to geographcal dispersion The percentage of time wind power is unavailable \(wind speed lower than 4 m/s or higher than 25 m/s to 17.59% in summer and from 6.75% to 10.23% in winter for an individual location. Transmission system operators have to increase the reserve requirements to backup the wind power when a new wind farm is connected to the grid. Bigger wind farms need higher reserves. But if multiple wind farms are considered, the wind unavailable time decreases dramatically The percentage of wind unavailable time is 3.38% in summer and 1.83% in winter when the two locations are considered together as one big wind farm distributed over a large geographical area Based on its power curve, GE 1.5MW XLE wind turbine can produce 5% of its rated power at 5 m/s, 10% at 6 m/s and 20% at 7 m/s  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1 61 121 181 241 301 361 421 481 541 W in d Sp ee d m

CAPACITY CREDIT FOR MULTIPLE WIND FARMS Capacity credit is a critical measure to power systems both from technical and economic considerations. It indicates the amount of generating capacity that can be counted on to help meet peak electricity demand. It is directly related with system reliability. The capacity credit calculation methods and regional applications are reviewed in [6]. Some utilities and Regional Transmission Operator \(RTO to calculate the capacity credit. PacifiCorp is an owner of wind power projects in Wyoming. The capacity credit of PacifiCorp is calculated using Z-method, which is a stochastic method to calculate peak load carrying capability of competing resources 8]. Others use a time-period basis to calculate wind capacity credit as shown in Table II  TABLE II WIND CAPACITY CREDIT CALCULATION BASED ON AVAILABILITY IN PEAK TIME Utility/RTO Capacity Credit Calculation CA ISO monthly historic capacity factor during peak hours of noon to 6:00 pm [7 ERCOT Initial 10%. Then use capacity factor during 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm in July [6 PJM 3-year rolling average capacity factor during 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm from June to August [6 Idaho Power 5% if the wind farm is more than 70% available during 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm in July[6  No matter what method or time period they use, the capacity credits are calculated based on wind power availability during the peak hours. Their calculations only focus on individual wind farm. The capacity credit varies from 5% to 30% of nominal ratings of wind farms depending on the methodology and the system conditions Z-method in [8], which has been used by PacifiCorp, can be used to calculate capacity credits for the two locations and their combination. The Reliability Test System \(RTS developed in [9] and assumptions in [8] are used because the information from utilities is not complete. The assumption from [8] is shown in Table III. The load carrying capability of new generation resources is defined as [8 L = R - Z \(?L2+ ?R2 where, R is the expected generation, Z is the ratio of the 


expected reserve to the standard deviation of the reserve, ?L is increment of peak load, ?R is the standard deviation of expected generation, ?S is the standard deviation of the reserve about mean. Details of calculations are given in [8].The installed wind power capacity in Wyoming is 814 MW as of April 30, 2009 [2] and the total generation capacity excluding wind power is 7,140MW. So the wind penetration in WY is 11%. The average load in WY is about 2,000 MW, which is not far from the assumption in Table III. The two locations are scaled up to 360 MW \(11% of total generation of RTS simulate Wyoming wind power. 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm in July and August is considered peak demand time in WY. The wind availability \(power produced by wind is greater than 0 locations and their combination is shown in Table IV and V The forced outage rate is the probability of zero output power of wind farms. In other words, the forced outage rate is one minus wind power availability  TABLE III MODEL ASSUMPTIONS Generation Load  Reserve Mean 3197MW 2850MW 345MW Standard Deviation 231MW 200MW 307MW Z 1.126 Reserve Margin 19  The load carrying capability is calculated for each location with capacity of 360 MW. It is then compared with 180 MW each placed at those two locations, with a resulting total of 360 MW, shown in the Tables IV-VI as combination. The load carrying capability, i.e. capacity credit, is shown in Table VI The capacity credit awarded to the combination of the two locations is highest and it is over twice of the lowest location A. Even the capacity credit of the better location B is lower than that of the combination. Both the system operator and wind farm owners can benefit from the combination of the two locations: the system operator can decrease the reserve because combination of multiple wind farms can increase the firm output; the owners of wind farms can share the capacity credit and lower the integration cost, which is proportional to the required reserve The above calculation is based on the wind data measured at locations around 300 km apart. Their correlations become lower when they are distributed farther. If the wind farms in Wyoming and Texas are considered as one big wind power resource, a higher proportion of wind power could be considered a firm resource to produce electricity  TABLE IV AVAILABILITY, CAPACITY FACTOR, AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF WIND POWER DURING 4:00PM TO 6:00PM IN JULY A B Combination Wind power Availability 76.08% 83.60% 97.31 Capacity Factor 19.81% 30.28% 25.05 Standard Deviation 85.33 115.28 81.56  TABLE V AVAILABILITY, CAPACITY FACTOR, AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF WIND POWER DURING 4:00PM TO 6:00PM IN AUGUST A B Combination Wind power Availability 85.75% 87.63% 96.24 Capacity Factor 25.49% 28.35% 26.92 Standard Deviation 105.37 97.20 86.36  TABLE VI WIND CAPACITY CREDIT OF THREE LOCATIONS AND THEIR COMBINATION A B Combination July 39.40 MW 64.23 MW 77.98 MW August 56.14 MW 69.62 MW 83.23 MW  V.  CONCLUSION Wind availability of a single wind farm is low, but if a 


Wind availability of a single wind farm is low, but if a number of wind farms distributed over a large distributed area are combined and looked at as a whole generation resource then the availability of wind power increases dramatically Real wind data from two locations in Wyoming is used in this paper. Compared with each location, the combination of the two locations can increase the wind availability. The capacity credit is higher when the wind power from the two locations is combined. As the method to calculate capacity credit used here is also used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good VI.

According to the performances that were based on these two features computation time and positioning accuracy, we compared various percentages of each features with each other For accurate positioning applications, we recommend that the size of clustering which high accuracies in positioning are needed. The performance of such systems needs to be relied on high percentage of the error in positioning. On the other hand, high percentage of computation time is desired for the applications that need short time in calculation or applications that have low computational power. Mobile phone positioning is one of these. In our experiment, we emphasized more on the reduction of computation time. The results show that our test route with 12.8 kilometer long was appropriate with 49 database clusters. As seen in the data in table 2, the results of the different number of clusters provided no effect to the positioning errors. Therefore, higher number of database clusters was appropriate B. The Results of Road Traffic Estimation In order to estimate the traffic status, we use the velocity of a mobile phone in a car to indicate road congestion. The easiest way to obtain car speed is by determining the travel distance divided by travel time \(space mean speed the estimated position from the  previous point was used to calculate the speed of the car. In this study, we made an experiment on a local road of 12.8 kilometer long. The estimated velocities calculated by the space mean speed method were compared with the reference velocities obtained from the GPS receiver. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the real speeds of a car and the estimated speeds    Figure 6. The velocity estimation The results in the figure 6 show that the line of the estimated velocity is able to track reference trajectory According the estimated velocity of entire route, we interpreted the traffic status as fluent with an average error 11 km/hr 0 20 40 60

CONCLUSTION This paper presented road traffic estimation by using the speed of a mobile phone in moving car to represent the traffic status. The mobile phone positioning was implemented by signal matching with the collected database. Since a large database size was desired, we built a new sensor system to automatically collect mobile phone information. A sensor system and the positioning algorithm are tested along a real road. According to the fact that our database is sizeable, a noise reduction technique was applied database implementation. Moreover, a fast nearest neighbor algorithm was also combined in reference point searching to reduce the computation time. The positioning results show that a mobile phone is able to employ as a traffic probe. The positioning technique is performed by using signal strength matching. The implementation of positioning algorithm combined with a proposed noise reduction and a fast nearest neighbor application has efficiency to estimate the traffic congestion ACKNOWLEDGMENT The work described in this paper was supported by Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology TGIST Technology Development Agency \(NSTDA Electronics and Computer Technology Center \(NECTEC Thailand  REFERENCES 1] C.

of end-to-end operational process considerations to provide emergency medical care as seen through the eyes and experience of a patient. The top level of this diagram represents a linear work flow of a patient from emergency notification \(e.g., ACN, 911 phone call provision, and arrival and definitive care provision at an emergency department and/or trauma center Based on findings, emergency responder processes may be viewed as dynamic or sequential. But the sequential representation is meant to take into account the patient experience, an important system design characteristic as described by Schooley and Horan [18 2. As shown in the second level \(from the top Figure 5, a multi-organizational view of the system architecture is an essential consideration for the ICTIN concept. As described throughout this paper and illustrated in Figure 6, many organizations are involved in emergency response activities, from emergency notification through care provision. Many other practitioners and organizations are involved in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 crash analysis, public health research, patient outcome research, and other analyses. Therefore, the architecture needs to accommodate the information and data needs of a wide variety of organizations including authorized access to information, while maintaining the privacy and security of patient information. Fortunately, the technology exists to enable these software quality attributes.  How to implement such attributes in a complex large-scale environment is a challenge yet to be resolved 3. Dynamic information sharing considerations are represented on the third and fourth levels of Figure 5 From this analysis, and prior research, a number of information types, or taxonomies, are captured analyzed, and distributed across EMS organizational actors and hardware and software systems. The view represented here is one that would allow for information to be fully utilized by authorized emergency responders \(and information systems downstream? points of an emergency response episode. For example, rather than waiting for a paramedic to click the ?submit report? button of an electronic patient care record, patient information would be dynamically \(and incrementally physicians at a receiving ED or trauma center. To enable such open systems, web services and related information architecture standards would need to be implemented across organizations and information systems so that both ?push? and ?pull? functionality could exist for any and all authorized users 4. End-to-end performance reporting capabilities across organizations and information systems are also enabled through such an architecture. The ability to pull any number of data elements not  Figure 5. Information Coordination across the Emergency Response Process  only benefits real-time clinical decision making, but would also allow for the creation of customized reports for real-time monitoring \(e.g., dashboards retrospective research and analysis. The idea here is that performance analysis becomes a system design consideration at the outset, as opposed to taking the traditional approach of constructing performance reports after the system has been built. As shown in Figure 6, reporting and analytics would be a key component of the ICTIN 5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics 


5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics are illustrated in Figure 6. Though alluded to in the above discussion, these include a. Security/Privacy: A standard suite of network software, and data security measures would be implemented to ensure safe transport of patient information in accordance with State and National privacy guidelines and laws Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 b. Patient tracking system: In order to accurately identify data from one system to another, there must be a common data identifier that could associate data with a patient, including vehicle, incident, medical information, care provision, receiving hospital medications administered, dispatched emergency resources, time of phone call, etc. The data would all be linked back to the patient for real-time and retrospective analysis. A patient tracking system would facilitate this core function of the ICTIN c. Directory and Access Services: This would be one or several secure databases that include a listing of all authorized organizations and individuals allowed to access ICTIN information. Individuals would register,,be approved by the managing organization, and then allowed access to certain information based on the information access policies prescribed by the managing body. The directory is controlled by a managing entity to be determined by the network stakeholders  5.1. Directions for Subsequent Phases  While there exists a need for an integrated crash trauma information network \(CTIN a paucity of guidance, literature, and directions on how to achieve such a complex system implementation.  As confirmed by the local and state focus group discussions in Minnesota, further exploration into the potential and feasibility of developing an integrated crash trauma information network would provide an innovative advancement from both a research and practice perspective. More specific recommendations for taking a phased and incremental research approach to move the concept forward are discussed below In our phased approach, several methods are being employed.  A first task would be to validate the Minnesota case studies by conducting a comparative case study review in another state. Findings from a cross-case comparison would be used to outline the parameters for an initial prototype of the integrated crash information system. The prototype would be a simplified ?sample? system to provide a ?proof of concept? and illustrate how crash information could be shared from the moment of impact, through emergency dispatch and response, and then into the emergency room and health treatment services. A key component of this prototype will be the integration of data around the patient. Our straw man system CrashHelp series of interviews and focus groups with significant stakeholders in the process, including departments of transportation, public safety, 911, emergency services, and healthcare. Small data sets from crash EMS, health information systems would be collected and used to develop and populate the prototype to demonstrate its utility for safety decision support and planning purposes.  Feedback analysis from policymakers, planners, public health, EMS, safety engineers, emergency planners and citizens will focus on operational, organizational, and policy 


on operational, organizational, and policy deployment challenges surrounding an enhanced EMS system, including possible benefits from its utilization  Figure 6. Organizations and Integrated Crash Trauma Information Network Services  6. Expected Benefits &amp; Conclusion  The Trauma network would organize the information around the patient, providing a user/consumer centric approach to information design and use. In doing so, the trauma network would extend current EMS systems to include a greater range of information, including information that has been requested by emergency room physicians but often not available. This information is expected to improve not only the timeliness, but also the quality of the emergency response and improve patient care An end-to-end trauma network would allow for more holistic data analysis that can be both visualized and conducted in real-time. Just as private sector operations have achieved benefits through integrated customer systems \(e.g., CRM apply to the victim of a trauma. In this case, the issue is not just better customer service but fundamental issues of life and death  8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
