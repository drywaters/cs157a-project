GENERAL WAVEFORM CHARACTERISTIC OF INRUSH I. INTRODUCTION CURRENT AND FAULT CURRENT Power transformers, are important equipments for power Transformer core saturation is the basic  reason why the transmission and transformation in power system, they have a transformer inrush current is formed  4].

So the safety operation of area, at this time, the exciting  current in the windings is very transformers is directly associated with the safety and small, approximate to zero. Once the  transformer is operated stabilization of power system. However, the correct operation or abnormal conditions occur, with  the change of core flux, the rate of transformer protection is relatively low for a long time. core may become saturable, and  exciting current in the According to the statistic, correct operation rate of transformer windings is rather high \(can  reach 10 times of rated current in protection for 220kv and above power system in 2004 was serious situation  current, and inrush only 79.05% [1]. Therefore, the performance of transformer current is characterized of its peaky  wave and its big dead protection is extremely urgent to be improved. angle generally [5], as shown in Fig.1 Now, Current longitudinal differential protection is used as The transformer core magnetic flux  change periodically the primary transformer protection for its simple principle and between linear condition and  saturation condition, inrush high sensitivity. However, differential principle is suitable for current is shown in Fig.1, a  lot of harmonics included, its only circuit that satisfies Kirchhoff's current law, while there fundamental component and  harmonic component will change is some relationship between transformer  s internal magnetic widely and periodically with the  change of core flux

Especially, inrush current turns to be the main Typical fault current waveform when  transformer internal source of unbalanced current and may induce mis-operation of fault occur which is shown in Fig.2  basically, it  s sinusoidal differential protection. The inrush current is mainly identified wave which is composed of  decaying DC component and a by the second harmonic restraint principle and dead angle small amount of harmonic component, and  the fundamental restraint principle [2]. But, with the decrease of transformer component and harmonic component  in fault current have no core material  s magnetic saturation point, the second harmonic change basically \(very small  time progress content in inrush current will reduce; on the other hand, due to This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(50707026 Shaanxi Provincial Education Department?07JK329?, and the National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province \(SJ08E220 978-1-4244-2487-0/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE Fig.1 Typical inrush current       Fig.2 Typical fault current III. IMPROVED HALF-CYCLE FOURIER ANALYSIS Analysis above indicates that, the change degree of the fundamental component in inrush current and fault current is of significant difference as time progress. By detecting the difference of fundamental current component in different time zone, we can find a way to identify inrush current. If there is great change of fundamental current content in different time zone, the current is judged as inrush current. This is the new principle thought to identify inrush current in this article The most important part in this algorithm is the extraction of fundamental current component. At present, the full wave Fourier algorithm is adopted to extract fundamental component, the full-wave Fourier analysis reflect the synthesis characteristics of waveform in one cycle. Besides, half-cycle Fourier analysis is also adopted to extract fundamental component, this algorithm can not only increase response speed but also can reflect the characteristics of the peak values of fundamental wave in half cycle. However, traditional half-cycle Fourier analysis is affected greatly by non-periodic DC component [8,9]. An improved method based on the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis is adopted to extract fundamental component of current waveform in different time zone, the improved algorithm is the composition of the real part of traditional half-cycle Fourier analysis and Mann-Morrison algorithm [10,11,12]. First of all, use traditional half-cycle Fourier analysis to get the real part IRe\(k of fundamental current component, k is sampling point; then according to the Mann-Morrison algorithm, the imaginary part of fundamental current is obtained \( ??  is sampling interval  2    ReReIm   k I k I k I    Then the peak value of fundamental is    2Im 2 R e 1  k I k I k I       Use the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis to extract the fundamental component from the current shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively, the fundamental component change as the time progress as shown in Fig.3. Fig.3\(a change condition of inrush current, Fig.3\(b current, obviously, the wave show that, as time go on, the fundamental peak values of inrush current change greatly, but it  s stable on the whole for fault current a b Fig.3 Fundamental current curve by Improved half-cycle Fourier analysis

ALGORITHM OF INRUSH CURRENT IDENTIFICATION The practical criterion based on the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis is given in the following.

EMTDC SIMULATION TEST STUDY For the Method to identify inrush current based on the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis, lots of simulation is proceeded using the electromagnetic transient simulation software EMTDC. System simulation model is shown in Fig.4, the transformer adopt Y/y0 rejoining method, 250MVA for capability, the voltage grade is 400/132kV, three DC current supply is used to simulate residual magnetism Simulation conditions contain transformer switch on with unload, light-load, full load, operate with internal fault, switch on with external fault, internal fault, etc. Differential current of transformer  s high voltage side and low voltage side id is what the Inrush current identification algorithm analyzes Fig.4 Transformer  s EMTDC simulation model A. Simulation of identification algorithm on typical conditions On some typical transformer operation or fault conditions different current waveformd of transformer are shown in Fig.5\(a d parameter and identification results are presented for the identification algorithm. If D is greater than threshold value 0.05, the current is judged to be inrush current, or else judged to be fault current, from Table I, we can see, these identification results on typical conditions are correct TABLE 1 INRUSH CURRENT IDENTIFICATION RESULT ON TYPICAL CONDITIONS Transformer conditions Value of D Identification result 1 Unload switch on and unsymmetrical inrush current is generated 0.3720 Inrush current 2 Unload switch on and symmetrical inrush current is generated 0.1143 Inrush current 3 Internal single phase to ground fault 0.0066 Fault current 4 Switch on with no-load and internal single phase to ground fault 0.0012 Fault current   a b  c d Fig.5 Differential current waveform of transformer B.Simulation test for the algorithm to identify inrush current For the conditions transformer switch on with unload light-load, full-load, internal fault, operate with internal fault etc, the performance of the algorithm is further studied on concrete conditions such as different switch angle, different residual magnetism, different fault condition and so on simulation result is shown in Table II-V.

CONCLUSIONS Inrush current waveform in transformer differential current is characterized of its peaky wave and its big dead angle relatively. Based on this, new method to identify inrush current is proposed, which adopts a fast improved Fourier Analysis integrating the real part of half-cycle Fourier analysis and Mann-Morrison analysis Theory analysis, EMTDC simulation test indicate that this method can identify inrush current and internal fault current effectively, and also have a good identification effect on symmetrical inrush current REFERENCE 1] Yu-lan ZHOU, Yu-ling WANG, Man-yong ZHAO, "Statistics of opera tion situation of protective relayings and automation devices of power systems in China in 2004," Power System Technology,2005,29 16 2] Zhi-guo HAO, Bao-hui ZHANG, Yun-long CHU, "Trend and situation of distinguish technology of transformer magnetizing inrush current Transformer,2005,42\(7 3] Ben-teng HE, Xi-dong XU, "Protection based on wave-comparison Proceedings of the CSEE, 1998,18\(6 4] Wei-jian WANG, Bing-yun HOU, "Theoretical fundamentals of large scale generator-transformer unit protection \(The second edition Beijing: China Electric Power Press,1989 5] Wei-jian WANG, "Generator and transformer relaying protection application \(The second edition 2005 6] Zheng-qing HAN, Shi-bin GAO, Qun-zhan LI, "New method to identify inrush current based on half-wave Fourier analysis," Automation of Electric Power Systems,2005,29\(14 7] Jun CHEN, Wei YAN, Jia-sheng CHEN, Zi-gang GUO, Quan- rong SHEN, "Novel identification method for magnetizing inrush current based on the comparability of different Fourier algorithm," Automation of Electric Power Systems, 2006, 30\(6 8] Fu-de JIN, Le HUANG, "The compensating characteristic analysis of Fourier algorithm," Relay, 2005,33\(21 9] Jing GAO, Jian-yong ZHENG, Zhen-don PAN, "Study of improved Fourier algorithm for digital protection in power system," Relay, 2002 30\(10 10] Yong-li LI, Chao-ying CHEN, Jia-li HE, "A fast algorithm based on half-cycle Fourier algorithm for protective relaying," Power System Technology, 1996,20\(1 11] A G Phadke, J S Thorp, "Computer relaying for power system Research Studies Press Ltd.

 8  Figure 14 \226 Oblique Shock Solution   observations can be made from the oblique shock solution curve as explained in the later paragraphs   The following observations can be made from the curve 
200  For any given M 1 there is a maximum value of  Therefore, at a given M 1   if  max then no solution is possible for a straight oblique shock wave. In such cases, the shock will be curved and detached 200  When  max there are two possible solutions for each value of and M, having two different wave angles. The large value of is called the strong shock solution and the smaller value of is called as the weak shock solution For strong solution the flow behind the shock becomes subsonic. For weak shock solution the flow remains supersonic, except for a small angle range values slightly smaller than max  200  If 0, then  2, gives rise to normal shock, or decreases to the limiting value that is shock disappears and only Mach waves prevail in the flow field  It is important to note that oblique shocks are essentially compression fronts across which the flow decelerates and the pressure, temperature and density jump to higher values. If the deceleration is such that the Mach number behind the shock continues to be  greater than unity, the shock is termed weak oblique shock If the downstream Mach numbe r becomes less than unity then the shock is called strong oblique shock corresponding to the upper portion of figure 14    It is essential to note that only weak oblique shocks are usually formed and it calls for special arrangements to generate strong oblique shocks  The relationship between the pressure before and after the oblique shock wave can be given by the equation    The Mach number behind the shock M 2 can be determined from the relation  
 


 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence      
 


 10    The above contour shows static pressure distribution across the model. It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
