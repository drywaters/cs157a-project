reimbursement problems   The Center for Health Computing and Statistics of the Ministry of Health worked on this subject and prepared a national eHealth Strategy. [1   In 2008 the National Center for Organization and Insurance of the Information System and Informatics in Health domain made an investigation about computerization of hospitals and other units with beds from Romania equipments, existence of specific informatic activity in hospitals, degree in which hospital staff use computers as a support of their activities. In this investigation there were considered 411 units with beds in Romania: public hospitals 
subordinated to the Ministry of Health and District Health Directorates, health centers and sanatoriums, from the 41 counties plus Bucharest; the units with beds of another subordinated ministries and the private ones are omitted. Of 411 units, responded to the questionnaire 383 units     In these hospitals there are a total of 481 servers and 16.225 PC\222s. The difference in equipment between hospitals, and between counties are significant   Practically all hospitals have at least one computer as it is mandatory reporting to CNAS \(National Clearing House 37 units declared that they have 3 or fewer computers, but 
over 43 hospitals declared that they have over 100 computers.

II. BASIC I NTEROPERABILITY FOR AN INFORMATIC SYSTEM IN A HOSPITAL   
 C Main activities in the cardiology department in the  County Hospital Timisoara   Admitting a patient in the hospital generates a file that will contain all the investigations and the analysis made to the patient, along with the diagnostic, treatments medications and ECG's. In the cardiology unit nurses work on three shifts, five nurses on the shift. Totally, a nurse answers for 2-4 wards with an average of four beds per ward. A nurse shift consists of 7 hours/day, but mostly they work after hours. A major fact that causes the extension of the working program is the lack of automation in the transmitting information process, in the actual stage this is made orally or written. Delivering the information on changing shifts is made through a notebook where are written down the newer information regarding the each patient treatment and medication along with the appointments for the i nvestigations, for the next shift of IEEE International Joint Conferences on Computational Cybernetics and Te\chnical Informatics \(ICCC-CONTI 2010 220 
A Basic interoperability  Using telemedicine systems provides better health care services for the patient and supports activity of medical staff. An EHR system consists in acquisition, storage presentation, and management of patient information, all represented in different formats such as audio, video or data and is accessible from distance   Implementing interoperability in medical systems is a mandatory requirement because of the fact that these systems need to provide the patient information to the medical staff as well to other system providers, in order to ensure health care continuity. While this requirement is essential to the sustainability of an EHR system interoperability is difficult to implement   In our country are more than 450 hospitals, and where an information system is present, the solutions are different from hospital to hospital. This variety of solutions generates the need to implement interoperability through all the medical systems, in order to provide quality medical services for the patient and correct data for statistics  The interoperability model proposed by IEEE is Basic Interoperability Data Model \(BIDM\e default data model for storing and exchanging metadata. The purpose of BIDM is to define the minimal set of information about assets that reuse libraries should be able to exchange in order to support interoperability. Since the BIDM describes a minimal set, other data that would be useful for interoperability, such as library data model information as well as communication protocol and related standards, are not included in the BIDM   The basic model for implementing the interoperability in any domain, according to IEEE Standard 1420.1, is shown in Fig. 1  This model consists in five classes, each of them having attributes and relationships. An attribute is defined as a field that contains information designed as text. A relationship is a field that it\222s used to refer to a class from another class   RIG Object is the main class in the interoperability model. The attribute \223Name\224 defined in the main class is inherited by all the subclasses                   Figure 1 IEEE Basic Interoperability Model   B Problems. Objectives. Motivation   The investigations made for implementing an interoperability solution in the cardiology department in the County Hospital in Timisoara, resulted in several major issues that burden medical staff with a lot of paper work and routine activities. The major problem found is the sharing of medical information of the patient. The data regarding the patient such as diagnostic and treatment are transmitted by MD to nurses and residents, and the information passed by at changing shifts is written down on paper registry. The intermediate decisions between diagnosis and treatment are not registered in the information system, only on paper, the medical file of the patient is not complete, the nurses being unable to have access to all medical decisions taken by MD for a patient   All the paper work done by nurses takes valuables time that can be dedicated to patient   Regarding the communication between the departments, in the cardiology department the medical results from the laboratories arrives written down on paper, the patient data being updated to SQL server of the hospital each two days   For every admission of the same patient, a new file is generated, resulting in a discontinuity of patient care that further will lead to missing data in statistics and other data processing   The goal of the currently presented system is to improve medical work flows and process in the cardiology department of the hospital using the mobile solutions and medical standards, led by the motivation that heart diseases are among first causes of death, and the cardiology department is a unit with people working under stress  This model design is dedicated mainly to the nurses, and work is done in order to automate the changing information process during nurse shifts and the process of medical care of the patient after the diagnostic was made, in order to ensure a real time connection between the nurses. Another goal is to implement step by step, the interoperability between the SCJUT departments, trying to reduce the amount of data transcriptions made by nurses, and dedicate this time to the main subject: the patient 
 


nurses. The main attributions of the nurses are preparing and administration of the medication \(orally, intravenous and intramuscular\making the appointments for the investigations, functional exploration and transmitting the general information about the patient evolution to the relatives. In the County Hospital in Timisoara, from the admitting until the discharging of a patient, takes place the process shown in Fig. 2                                Figure 2 Main work flows in cardiology department

For any single patient, the file XML is composed by three nodes  Cardiology Data, Personal Data and Hospital Data. Every node will have it corresponding sub nodes, and all three subclasses \(treatment, medication and lab results\ave functions such as ad, modify or delete. To implement the interoperability between PocketPC\222s and the applications on the workstations, we will code the XML file using the HL7 standard   The access to the patient\222s fields is customized, the nurses can modify only the medication field, and the cardiologist will be able to edit the fields representing the diagnostic and treatment   
 using XML files and HL7 standards   Based on the previous observations made in the cardiology department, a model of the communication circuits and the flow of patient data between medical staff is proposed \(Fig 2\ In order to improve the work flow and to convert it to a informatic system it is used the SOA flexible set of design principles in the system development and integration phases  Based on the BIDM model, we defined the minimal set of data that will be used for designing the informatic system for the cardiology department. The proposed model will consider the patient data as the main class, and the attribute 223Name\224 that is inherited by all the all subclasses, is the CNP in our case, based on the fact that it\222s a valid and unique field for every patient. In the class \223Element\224, are stored other information about the patient such as name, address age; class \223Organization\224 is used as a deposit for the basic data of the hospital where the patient is admitted For the cardiology department, the \223Asset\224 class it\222s composed by    S ervice   The cardiology system prototype is based on SOA architecture, in order to ensure interoperability between departments. Using SOA, we developed the system R. Pintea et al.  Interoperability Solution for an EMR System Applied i\n a Cardiology Department Supported by Mobile Communication 221

functions and the XML file that can be use in the other departments   In the software design SOA provides a set of principles that standardize the concept used by systems during development and integration phases. Such architecture can be used as a software package that will operate as an interoperable service. Different organization can integrated or use such services or software modules, even if their client systems are diverse. SOA defines the interface in terms of protocols and functionality, and separates the functions in distinct units that can be access through the network allowing the users to combine them and reuse in production These services communicate one with each other using the XML formats                     Figure 4 SOA Model of the PocketPC system for hospital  The most frequent method to build SOA is using the Web Services standards, such as SOAP, that have gained a large usability in the industry. This standard provides a large interoperability and a minimal level of security for the software  The XML file is generated when the patient pass the registration and it\222s admitted in the hospital, the file being passed to all PocketPC and TabletPC devices through a Web Service   First node of the file is named after the department where the patient is admitted, in our case CARD, and an unique field for identifications, the CNP of the patient. The sub node \223Medical Data\224 is composed of four sub nodes Diagnostic, Treatment, Medication and Results. The last three nodes can be expanded as necessary, considering the fact that a patient can have multiple medications, treatments and lab results. In the node \223Results\224 are two types of fields             
200  Image results like a radiology scan or a CT   The image results will be stored in a common folder with level of access in the hospital server   Using the XML format is a step forward to the globalization, providing validity, independence over the software application, simplicity and accessibility   The XML files are text sequence created for structuring storing and transporting the information. In the coding environment, XML is declared as a class, allowing the execution of complex operations and storing a large number of medical data. In order to provide interoperability between the departments of this hospital, we used the XML structure shown in Fig. 5                                 Figure 5 XML Model of the main class \223Patient\224

F Feedback of the medical staff   The system proposed is an experimental one and it\222s functionality needs to me monitored. The cardiology department is an unit where the reaction time of the nurses  is vital, therefore a preliminary training is needed. The deployment of the PocketPC system must be made gradually, and not suppressing totally the old system at once. The two systems will work together until the new one is fully stabled and valid. Being two systems, they will be managed using software for keeping the feedback of the medical staff such as the one in Fig. 6                    Figure 6 Feedback software interface  IEEE International Joint Conferences on Computational Cybernetics and Te\chnical Informatics \(ICCC-CONTI 2010 222

In this context we are using SOA approach for the model design of the system destined to the SCUJT. This approach will allow an easier and faster configuration of the system, by using the interoperability and medical standards. Using this system will improve the work process and the knowledge of the nurses, they being able to consult medical journal via Internet The EMR systems are feasible in countries during transition, but there is the problem of limited resources. [4  Healthcare systems have been driven mainly by the need to report aggregate statistics for government or funding agencies 5 M R s y st e m w i l l i m pr ov e t he l e g i bi l i t y of c l i ni c a l not e s  will provide decision support for drug ordering, including allergy warning and drug incompatibilities [6 h e s y stem  model proposed will supply a set of reminders to prescribe drugs or administrate them    Using a standard format for the lab results, will allow implementing the warnings for abnormal results ou r sy ste m    Although is a system addressing mainly to the nurses, it can support the reporting of the outcomes, budgets and supplies  an d can be u s ed in clin ical res earch being a powerful tool for monitoring chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension and heart failure In order to reveal some benefits of our system for a cardiology department, we compared it with a telemedicine project developed by Trieste University in collaboration with IRCCS Children Hospital Burlo. The basis of this project was that there is a rare use of standards protocols in the cardiology environment. This limits the integration and scalability of the used clinical information systems. The cause of this is the large diversity of the exams done and their outputs T h e ca rdi o l ogy t e l e m e di ci n e proj ect i s  based on mobile devices This project was created in order to optimize the management of the cardiology activity at the ASS1 Territorial Body of Trieste. A new functionality was added and it refers to mobile ECG. This allows the medical staff to view the patient ECG on their mobile devices.  The development of the system comprises the construction of a generic Java based DICOM workstation [11 a n d P D A  R. Pintea et al.

G System functions and design criteria   In the cardiology unit take place two process simultaneous one invasive and one non invasive. During these processes the patient is investigated and as a result the cardiologist makes a diagnostic. The model above is destined for manage a patient after the diagnostic was made and the minimal set of functions consists of the possibility to view the ECG and the lab analysis, the protocol for transfer the information between the mobile devices and the PC. The nurses will be able to make appointments to the laboratory for the patient\222s investigations and manage the treatment All the mobile devices are conn ected to the main server, the patient\222s data being available in real time to all the nurses Fig. 7, 8             Figure 7 Connectivity between mobile devices  The system, respects the basics of interoperability, so it can be used even if there is no PocketPC available, by using another mobile device such as Smart Phone or TabletPC The PocketPc\222s sub network will communicate with the registration, radiology and laboratories. The communication consists in sharing the XML file of the patients. The analysis results will be add to the XML nodes and the images result are saved in the main server, using the DICOM standard. The connection between the PocketPC\222s will be assured by a wireless network, each device having his own ID code                Figure 8 Connectivity between departments  Based on the activities observed in the cardiology department of the SCUJT, we have highlighted the following points of interest needed to automate the process   
 


based terminals with GSM, GPRS or WIFI possibility to connect to medical devices, also Java based These terminals allow easy visualization, measurement and manipulation of ECG data This mobile project was proposed in a hospital where was already implemented a functional telemedicine project, so the background was larger. The hardware infrastructure was already configured and the medical staff was already trained to use mobile devices The project presented in this paper does not intend to optimize an existing telemedicine system in the SCUJT cardiology department, but to make the step form the paper management of the patient to an automatic system and implementing standards for communication The nurses in SCUJT cardiology department administrate their patient using paper documents and the medical data are transmitted by written down on notebooks. The advantage of using the proposed systems structure is the simplicity and represents a low cost solution The system that is for now a prototype is a viable solution that is destined to make the transition from the old system to a new automated one Its basic functions are implemented after studying the nurse workflow processes and developed an algorithm of their activity in the cardiology department  IV. C ONCLUSIONS F UTURE DEVELOPMENT   PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION   Currently there is no full success of the reform of the patient data management in the cardiology department, this being a difficult and lengthy process. From the nurse feedback there was a generally open attitude regarding the usage of mobile devices in the unit as a patient data management The main obstacles impeding the establishment of an automated system are the high cost of implementation with the mobile devices, the short battery life of these and the reluctance of the doctors and nurses referring to prescription and treatment of patient. This system will not replace the doctor or the nurse in terms of decision makers in diagnosis prescription and patient treatment. This will require nurse training in the use of mobile devices and the software installed. These facilities will reduce waiting time and increase nurse efficiency   The prototype system was realized as a low cost solution, in collaboration with voluntary nurses from SCJUT and can be  used as a starting point to develop other projects or adding new features. Following this experience, we concluded that relatively large project can be developed in a group containing both IT and health professionals. The technical solution is low cost and appropriate for the cardiology unit   The development process was based on cycle V, and the introduction of new components will use a metaincremental approach. Currently the system is intended for the SCJUT cardiology department, but in the future it could be extended to other hospitals and family doctors. Since the increase of hardware performance of mobile devices knows an exponential growth, there is no need that application runs on systems with limited resources and it can be developed using new technologies. However one important issue remains the fact that mobile devices work with batteries and the stage of batteries development is much behind the actual requirements   The subject and the achievements presented in this paper are a started point for the automation process system of the patient in the cardiology unit and the integration in the national process of automation in the medical sector A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was partially supported by the strategic grant POSDRU/88/1.5/S/50783, Project ID50783 \(2009\ cofinanced by theEuropean Social Fund \226 Investing in People,  within the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013  R EFERENCES

This pixel results from the combination of three endmembers \(green grass, bare red brick, galvanized steel metal  observation is corrupted by an additive Gaussian noise with signal to noise ratio SNR = 20dB. A typical resulting mixed pixel is depicted in Fig. 1 \(below Figure 1. Top: endmember spectra: green grass \(solid line bare red brick \(dotted line dashed line SNR 20dB This simulation considers a spectrum library composed of 6 endmembers that are provided by the ENVI software [23, p 1035]. These spectra, representative of a urban or suburban environment, are depicted in Fig. 2 Figure 2. Endmember spectra of the library The results presented here are obtained for NMC = 20000 iterations, including Nbi = 200 burn-in iterations. The first step of the analysis consists of identifying the different combinations of endmembers in the matrices M\(t 4 the sampler. Among the Nr = NMC ?

The probabilities of each of these combination occurrence, depicted in Fig. 3 are clearly in favor of the endmember matrix M = [s2s5s6 which is in good agreement with the mixing scenario. Indeed the maximum probability P [M = [s2, s5, s6] | y] = 0.98 corresponds to the actual spectra involved in the mixture Figure 3.

The supervised algorithm assumes that the 6 endmember spectra of the library \(depicted in Fig. 2 ture. Hence, with this approach, the vector to be estimated is 0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4]T . The mean squared errors \(MSE for the supervised algorithm and our library-based algorithm are reported in Table 1.

Assuming that the endmembers belong to a known spectral library, a reversible-jump MCMC method allowed one to identify the macroscopic materials actually involved in the mixture. In that sense, it constituted an original semi-supervised algorithm for linear unmixing of hyperspectral images 7. REFERENCES 1] C.-I Chang, Ed., Hyperspectral data exploitation.

Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
