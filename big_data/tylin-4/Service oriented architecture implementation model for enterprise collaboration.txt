 7  more precise determination of the solar modulation parameters 003 for further improvement of the GCR spectra is necessary because the 003 used in this work was estimated in different ways from the BESS experiment. More benchmarking of the proton interaction models and the JENDL-HE using more experimental data are needed Based on the results from the benchmarking, the nuclear reaction models used in PHITS might need to be improved Finally all globally acquired data of the chemical composition of the lunar soil should be used in the simulations  5  C ONCLUSION  PHITS simulations of equilibrium neutron density profiles in the lunar subsurface from galactic cosmic ray \(GCR protons and alpha particles were compared with experimental data by the Apollo 17 Lunar Neutron Probe Experiment \(LNPE\. In this work, GCR spectra based on the BESS measurements, well benchmarked proton nuclear interaction models, and the latest evaluated nuclear data JENDL-High-Energy File \(JENDL-HE\ were used. The results using the best proton nuclear interaction models Cugnon Old E 3 GeV\+ JAM E 3 GeV\, reproduced the LNPE data within the experimental errors of 15 measurement\\(systematic hallower than 300 g/cm 2 However, they were up to 30% higher than the measurements in the deeper region.

can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been placed appropriately by analyzing significant navigational patterns \(association rules In our experiments the percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by rules was calculated by dividing the number of common items in hyperlink sets and whole ranking lists for a given page, by the number of hyperlinks on the page separately for direct, indirect and complex rules \(Fig. 8 Note that the number of hyperlinks was put in the denominator as opposed to calculations in section 7.4 where it was ranking length 48 89%87 0 20 40 60 80 100 direct indirect complex Figure 8. The average percentage of all hyperlinks confirmed by rules Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and  Applications \(ISDA  05 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE The average percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by direct rules amounted to only 48%, probably because there were too few of them. Indirect and complex rules, on the other hand, confirmed many more hyperlinks  87% and 89%, respectively, due to their larger quantity. These relatively great values that we received may have resulted from the enormous differences between the average number of hyperlinks on a page  10 and the average ranking length: 51, 177, 180 for direct, indirect and complex rules respectively. Concluding, indirect and complex rules appear to be better at assessing the usefulness of hyperlinks compared to direct rules Note that in any case at least 11% of hyperlinks were not confirmed by any rule, so they may be recommended to be removed from the content of pages 8. Conclusions and future work Complex rules combining both direct and indirect rules usually increase the length of rankings compared to those based on direct associations. This helps overcome the problem of a multitude of pages with too short rankings Fig. 5 quested ranking length \(Fig. 6 rules substantially change the order of ranking lists \(Fig. 2 and 3 greater extent only confirm hyperlinks existing on web pages compared to lists extracted from complex rules, for short and long ranking lengths \(Fig. 7 of rules, especially indirect and complex ones, can be useful for the assessment of hyperlinks Concluding, far more diverse indirect rules can significantly improve potential value of recommendation. Nevertheless, to confirm the usefulness of indirect rules for end users, some tedious tests with their participation are required Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to thank Marcin Pilarczyk for providing cleansed data about hyperlinks on WUT pages 9.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
