So the safety operation of area, at this time, the exciting current in the windings is very transformers is directly associated with the safety and small, approximate to zero. Once the transformer is operated stabilization of power system. However, the correct operation or abnormal conditions occur, with the change of core flux, the rate of transformer protection is relatively low for a long time core may become saturable, and exciting current in the According to the statistic, co rrect operation rate of transformer windings is rather high \(can reach 10 times of rated current in protection for 220kv and above power system in 2004 was

Fig.1 Typical inrush current       Fig.2 Typical fault current III IMPROVED HALF CYCLE FOURIER ANALYSIS Analysis above indicates that, the change degree of the fundamental component in inrush current and fault current is of significant difference as time progress. By detecting the difference of fundamental current component in different time zone, we can find a way to identify inrush current. If there is great change of fundamental current content in different time zone, the current is judged as inrush current. This is the new principle thought to identify inrush current in this article The most important part in this algorithm is the extraction of fundamental current component. At present, the full wave Fourier algorithm is adopted to extract fundamental component, the full-wave Fourier analysis reflect the synthesis characteristics of waveform in one cycle. Besides, half-cycle Fourier analysis is also adopted to extract fundamental component, this algorithm can not only increase response speed but also can reflect the characteristics of the peak values of fundamental wave in half cycle. However, traditional half-cycle Fourier analysis is affected greatly by non-periodic DC compon A n i m pro v ed m e th od bas ed on th e improved half-cycle Fourier analysis is adopted to extract fundamental component of current waveform in different time zone, the improved algorithm is the composition of the real part of traditional half-cycle Fourier analysis and Mann-Morrison algorithm [10,11,1 i rs t of all u s e  traditional half-cycle Fourier analysis to get the real part I Re k of fundamental current component k is sampling point; then according to the Mann-Morrison algorithm, the imaginary part of fundamental current is obtained    is sampling interval   sin 2  1   1    Re Re Im       k I k I k I  1 Then the peak value of fundamental is       2 Im 2 Re 1 k I k I k I    2 Use the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis to extract the fundamental component from the current shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively, the fundamental component change as the time progress as shown in Fig.3. Fig.3\(a\e fundamental change condition of inrush current, Fig.3\(b\ is that for fault current, obviously, the wave show that, as time go on, the fundamental peak values of inrush current change greatly, but its stable on the whole for fault current a\inrush current              \(b\ fault current Fig.3 Fundamental current curve by Improved half-cycle Fourier analysis IV A LGORITHM OF INRUSH CURRENT IDENTIFICATION The practical criterion based on the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis is given in the following. Assume that the transformer differential protective system is started, for the sampling time t 1  t 2   t N in a period of time \(for example a period of power frequency\ in the following, utilize the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis equation \(1\ and \(2\o work out the fundamental current peak values I 1  I 2   I N in a half period of power frequency after the sampling time. For convenience, transform the fundamental current peak value into relative value    2  1    N k I I I k k       3 Where I  is the mean value of I 1  I 2   I N then, work out the value of discriminant parameter D    1   1   1  1 2  2  2 2  1           N I I I N D 4 Parameter D reflect the variance of fundamental currents peak values actually \(relative value\. According to D inrush current is identified If D  differential current is judged to be inrush current If D   it is judged to be fault current In the criterion is a threshold value that is very small Detailed theoretical derivation, simulation study and dynamic analogous test, all of the above indicate that make 0.05 is relatively appropriate Assume that is the initial angle of the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis. Then algorithm for real and imaginary part of the fundamental peak value is   2 100 100 1 1  cos   4   T dt t t i T a       5  sin 2       1 1 1              a a b 6 Mean value of the fundamental peak values      d b a A   2 0 2 1 2 1     2 1 7 Discriminant parameter D is      d A b a D 2 2 0 2 1 2 1  1      2 1    8 From referen w e  k n o w t h at s i ng lep h as e tra n s f o r m er  inrush current can be described as follows        S m r S m S B B B t U L t i           cos cos 1 0   1 1 9 Where U m represent the peak value of rating voltage S B S represent saturation flux and saturation flux density respectively B r represent remnant flux density B m represent rating flux density corresponding to U m  L represent the inductance in transformer excitation loop 1 represent angular frequency of fundamental represent the initial angle when transformer switch on For large-scale power transformers, the possible minimum value of B S is 1.15 times the value of B m the possible maximum value of B r is 0.9 times the value of B when is 0  
 


and other conditions are constant the dead angle of inrush current is minimum, secondary harmonic content is also minimum, that is the practically serious condition for the analysis of inrush current th e m i ni m u m v a l u e of  discriminant parameter D worked out on this condition is 0.0897 From referen w e ca n g e t th e m a t h e m atic m odel o f  fault current   cos   1 1 0 k M k k t t k I e I t i   012      10 where I 0 represent the peak value of decaying DC component represent the decaying time coefficient of decaying DC component I k represent the peak value of fundamental and k th harmonic k represent the initial angle of fundamental and k th harmonic 1 represents the fundamental angular frequency From referen w e can kn o w t h at w h en us i n g t h e  half-cycle Fourier analysis to extract fundamental peak value the third harmonic and above have little effect on that algorithm, and the half-cycle Fourier analysis itself can filter odd harmonics, so the mathematic model of fault current can be simplified as  cos   1 2 1 0 k k k t t k I e I t i   012      11 where parameter selection range are as follows: the peak value of decaying DC component I 0 0~2 I 1 the decaying time coefficient of decaying DC component  the peak value of second harmonic I 2 0~1 I 1 the initial angle of second harmonic  The Initial angle of fundamental   The maximum value of discriminant parameter D obtained from the algorithm is about 0.0001 with all these conditions considered V EMTDC SIMULATION TEST STUDY For the Method to identify inrush current based on the improved half-cycle Fourier analysis, lots of simulation is proceeded using the electromagnetic transient simulation software EMTDC. System simulation model is shown in Fig.4, the transformer adopt Y/y0 rejoining method, 250MVA for capability, the voltage grade is 400/132kV, three DC current supply is used to simulate residual magnetism Simulation conditions contain transformer switch on with unload, light-load, full load, operate with internal fault, switch on with external fault, internal fault, etc. Differential current of transformers high voltage side and low voltage side i d is what the Inrush current identification algorithm analyzes Fig.4 Transformers EMTDC simulation model A. Simulation of identification algorithm on typical conditions On some typical transformer operation or fault conditions different current waveformd of transformer are shown in d\s shown in Table I, D values of discriminant parameter and identification results are presented for the identification algorithm. If D is greater than threshold value 0.05, the current is judged to be inrush current, or else judged to be fault current, from Table I, we can see, these identification results on typical conditions are correct TABLE 1 I NRUSH CURRENT IDENTIFICATION RESULT ON TYPICAL CONDITIONS  Transformer conditions Value of D Identification result 1 Unload switch on and unsymmetrical inrush current is generated 0.3720 Inrush current 2 Unload switch on and symmetrical inrush current is generated 0.1143 Inrush current 3 Internal single phase to ground fault 0.0066 Fault current 4 Switch on with no-load and internal single phase to ground fault 0.0012 Fault current  a\ unsymmetrical Inrush current       \(b\ symmetrical Inrush current  c\ase to ground fault         d\nload and phase to ground fault  Fig.5 Differential current waveform of transformer B.Simulation test for the algorithm to identify inrush current For the conditions transformer switch on with unload light-load, full-load, internal fault, operate with internal fault etc, the performance of the algorithm is further studied on concrete conditions such as different switch angle, different residual magnetism, different fault condition and so on simulation result is shown in Table II-V.

Two scenarios \(i\ Time dependent power variation and ii Time dependent flow variations have been presented A pyramid shaped transient profile for varying power is used to establish a spatial and time grid independent temperature and flow distributions It was shown that using a larger step reduces computational time however may obtain inaccurate results. A comparison was made between the transient model and the steady state model which showed accuracy of the transient model One case study was presented in which a CRAC failed. The study showed the importance of a transient model in showing temperature overshoots which a steady state model is not capable of showing  REFERENCES 1  M ik e  C   a n d  W e a v e r  T     D a ta  c e n te r  c o o lin g    u s in g  w e tbulb economizers ASHRAE Journal August 2008 pp 5258  2  J u d g e  J    P o u c h e t J    E k b o te  A    a n d  D ix it S     R e d u c i n g  data center energy consumption ASHRAE Journal November 2008, pp. 14-26  3  M ik e  C    W e a v e r  T    D u n n a v a n t K    a n d  F is h e r  M    Reduce data center cooling cost by 75%, ASHRAE Journal April 2009, pp. 34-41 4  S a li m  M     E n e r g y  in  d a ta  c e n te r s  b e n c h m a r k in g  a n d  lessons learned, ASHRAE Journal, April 2009, pp. 24-32  5  S c h m id t R    I y e n g a r  M    B e a t y  D    a n d  S h r i v a s ta v a  S    Thermal Profile of a High Density Data Center  Hot Spot Heat Fluxes of 512 Watts/ft 2  Proceedings of the ASHRAE A nnual Meeting Symposium DE-05-11 Denver June 25 th 29 th 2005  6  S c h m id t R     E f f e c t  o f  D a t a  C e n te r  C h a r a c te r i s tic s  o n  D a ta  Processing Equipment Inlet Temperatures Advances in Electronic Packaging Proceedings of the Pacific Rim/ASME International Electronic Packaging Technical Conference and Exhibition Interpack Vol 2 Paper IPACK2001-15870 Kauai, Hawaii, July 8-13, pp. 1097-1106 \(2001  7  S c h m id t R    C r u z  E   a n d  M   K   I y e n g a r    C h a lle n g e s  o f  data center thermal management IBM Journal of Research and Development, Volume 49, Number 4/5, \(2005  8  B h o p te  S    I y e n g a r  M    S a m m a k ia  B    S c h m id t R  a n d  Agonafer D Numerical modeling of data center clusters  immpact of model complexity Proceedings of the International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Chicago, Illinois, November \(2006  9  B h o p te  S    S a m m a k ia  B    I y e n g a r  M    S c h m id t R  a n d  Agonafer D Effect of Under-Floor Blockages on Data Center Performance Proceedings of the Inter-Society Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems ITherm San Diego California June 2006  10  B h o p te  S    S a m m a k ia  B    I y e n g a r  M    a n d  S c h m id t  R    Guidelines on Managing Under Floor Blockages for Improved Data Center Performance Proceedings of the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress IMECE\, Chicago, November \(2006  11  B h o p te  S    A g o n a f e r  D    S c h m id t  R   a n d  S a m m a k ia  B    Optimization of Data Center Room Layout to Minimize Rack Inlet Air Temperature Journal of Electronic Packaging December 2006, Vol. 128, Issue 4, pp. 380  387  12  B a s h   C  E   P a te l  C  D   S h a r m a   R  K    D y n a m ic  Thermal Management of Air Cooled Data Centers Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems San Diego California June 2006  13  B e ite lm a l M  H    P a te l C     T h e r m o F l u id s  P r o v is io n i n g  of a High Performance High Density Data Center HPL-2004146R1, September 24, 2004  14  S h a r m a  R    B a s h  C    P a te l C    F r ie d r ic h  R    a n d  C h a s e  J    Balance of power  dynamic thermal management of internet data centers, Published by IEEE Computer Society, January pp. 42-49, \(2005

with correlation and Rayleigh resolution for source in corner of pixel 5. CONCLUSIONS The psf correlation technique while only slightly better then the threshold detector in the best case scenario, NEO in center of pixel, is a great improvement over the threshold detector in more difficult scenarios such as NEO close to edge of a pixel and telescope optics not properly aligned for correct seeing at time of data collection These factors make ground-based telescopes a viable option for detecting NEOs of 140 meters and larger by incorporating the psf correlation technique at Nyquist resolution; thereby, saving money versus using expensive space-based telescopes. Also, ground-based telescopes are more numerous and multiple ground-based telescopes can scan more sky than one space-based telescope. Multiple ground-based sites can be used for statistical purposes of improving asteroid detection [4]. Multiple ground-based images can be averaged to reduce the background noise thereby, increases detection probability. Also, space-based telescopes are more difficult to acquire time, so groundbased telescopes are a more viable option for NEO detection Space telescopes incur significant costs and expensive maintenance and can have long down times waiting for maintenance. If the correlation process described in this paper were used for ground-based telescopes, cost-savings could be significant while detection capabilities would only be slightly impacted The NEO report uses Rayleigh resolution in order to increase the number of NEO photons within one pixel to increase detection probability using a threshold detector The psf correlation process uses the Nyquist resolution to allow for better definition of the psf within the image. This spreads the NEO photons over more pixels, but the psf correlation process allows for better detection than the NEO report process For ground-based telescopes, elevation is important for the best seeing parameters as mentioned in Section 2. Using the psf correlation can limit the impact of lower elevations on the detection capabilities of a telescope, but not eliminate the detriment of lower elevation. It is still in the best interest of NEO detection to use the highest elevations possible with the best seeing parameters, but where cost prohibits the acquisition of higher elevation this process can help limit the impact The false alarm rate is minimal at SNR 6 as was computed in by equation \(11 the false alarm rate only slightly and the increase in detection capability will greatly outweigh the false alarm rate increase. Figures 5 through 8 show a great improvement from SNR 6, the far left of each graph, to SNR 5. The improvement is typically 2 times better detection probability. The psf correlation process improves 8 the detection capabilities for NEOs. The psf correlation process exceeds the NEO reports requirement of 90 detection of NEOs with a visual magnitude of 20.7. It could also detect a majority of NEOs over 50 meters The psf correlation process will require significant computational time and resources. This can be overcome by segmenting the images to be correlated and distributing them to several processers. This is a significant difference between the psf correlation process and the standard threshold detection process used today. The computational intensity of this process can be handled by most mainframes Movement of the NEO within the image from pixel to pixel during exposure is an issue for both the NEO report process and the process described in this paper. Integration must be long enough to allow for enough photons for detection, but 


long enough to allow for enough photons for detection, but not so long as to allow the NEO to move into another pixel thereby distributing it  s photons into more pixels while the background intensity increases 6. CONCLUSION Nyquist resolution with psf correlation has been shown to be less affected by the atmospheric seeing parameter than just using a threshold detector alone. Using a psf correlation technique for Nyquist resolution images has been shown to increase the probability to discover NEOs over the current aliasing and threshold technique in all situations addressed in this paper ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The opinions and views expressed by the authors are not necessarily those of the Department of Defense or the United States Air Force REFERENCES 1] Near-Earth Object Science Definition Team, Study to Determine the Feasibility of Extending the Search for Near-Earth Objects to Smaller Limiting Diameters August 22, 2003 2] E.

Figure 15  ISM Data Flow serializer highlighted in yellow the design to ensure the clock-to-outputs of the individual serial signals were all matched indicating that at least on chip the design had no skew Finally we used a test bed layout with HyperLynx to prove that our part to part latencies were within acceptable ranges given the high design speed FPGA Design Rate The FPGA design used to verify the design speed was a relatively simple 8-bit latch and shift register shown in Figure 14 Figure 14 shows that the base clock is twice as fast as the output clock which is meant to simulate a recovered clock This is not necessarily a design requirement but would be necessary if the telemetry clock were an input to the design as was the case on the WISE mission This implies that the maximum frequency given by the timing tool for the design is twice the output clock Figure 14 shows only an 8-bit shift register but naturally depending on how the memory was organized more might be required The more bits used in the shift register the more internal clock skew slows the design If a wider bus were required it would be better to increase the depth of the input registers to maintain a high-speed design as opposed to increasing the number of output shift registers The results of this test were a maximum device clock speed of 336.7 MHz double data rate and a maximum output clock speed of 168.35 MHz in the Actel RTAX2000S as given by Actel Timing Designer This meets our requirement of 150 MHz on the clock signal with a margin of 12 FPGA Design Skew Using this same prototype design and mapping the outputs to physical pins we ensured the pin-to-pin skew was matched This skew is the amount of time it takes the edge to propagate from the internal logic to the physical pin on the part The results were as follows Path 1 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 2 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK N Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 3 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 4 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA N Clock to Out ns 7.014 The clock-to-output skews are all matched indicating the clock and data signals leave the part simultaneously and no delay is caused by mismatched skew Board Latency Simulation After a preliminary board layout was completed board simulations were performed on the signals from the FPGA to the LVDS repeater and ultimately to the front panel as shown in Figure 16 All of these simulations were performed in HyperLynx Boardsim 8.0 with manufacturer-provided IBIS models for the Integrated Circuits ICs The waveform given in Figure 17 is captured at the FPGA Figure 16  ISM Data Flow buffer highlighted in yellow Figure 17  FPGA LVDS output waveform simulations green/red  single-ended clock at FPGA blue  differential clock at destination The HyperLynx simulation was performed using a signal switching speed of 180 MHz to ensure adequate margin for the desired signal frequencies The rise times given in Table 9 are roughly one-tenth the simulated signal period 5.5 ns at 180 Mhz indicating they will not impede the switching frequency by slowing the time to the threshold voltage at the receiver The simulated scope shots for these signals indicate crisp edges and transitions The receiving part is an LVDS bus repeater meant to protect the radiation-hardened FPGA from any front-panel transients that might inadvertently occur during testing At the input to the repeater the simulated signal waveform is given in Figure 18 The transition regions for LVDS are shown as blue lines in Figure 18 While there is a considerable amount of overshoot 11 


Figure 18  LVDS signals at buffer input difference shown and re\003ections on the signal line from the repeater the transition region of the signal is very clean even simulated at 180 MHz This will easily meet our 150 MHz frequency requirement Signal characteristics are tabulated in Table 9 Signal Rise Time ps Fall Time ps Undershoot mV Overshoot mV Margin mV CLK 729.0 698.4 212 250 288 CLK903.1 685.4 256 150 244 DATA 738.9 702.8 216 250 284 DATA876.4 717.8 256 150 244 Table 9  FPGA LVDS output signal characteristics In addition to signal characteristics and waveforms the signal-to-signal skew was measured at the buffer input Obviously these values should be as small as possible to prevent modifying the board Like most differential signaling modes LVDS requires matched impedance signal pairs to function optimally HyperLynx was used to 002ne tune the termination on each differential pair and to match all of the trace impedances to this termination The skew was minimal Table 10 First LVDS Signal Second LVDS Signal Receiving Rise Skew ps Receiving Fall Skew ps CLK DATA 58.32 50.54 Table 10  LVDS rising and falling skew measured at receiver The Receiving Rise and Fall skews are the values for skew between the two signals as each signal passes the LVDS threshold voltage measured at the FPGA The time difference between these two crossings is the number shown in Table 10 Rise skew is measured on the rising edge and fall skew is measured on the falling edge as illustrated in Figure 19 Figure 19  LVDS receiver slew measurement Given that these skews were measured at 180 MHz skew between signals at 150 MHz will not inhibit data transfer by allowing the clock and data lines to get out of sync 6 C ONCLUSIONS It is clear that there are many places where timing is of great concern in the ISM data 003ow The initial data input is driven by the instrument interface timing the bandwidth of the FPGA FIFO buffers the speed of the formatter FPGA and the bandwidth of write accesses to the 003ash-memory The transmitter side of the data 003ow is dependent on the bandwidth of the read accesses to the 003ash-memory the FPGA FIFO buffer bandwidth the FPGA serializer frequency and the physical signal characteristics of the FPGA to the frontpanel interface A table summarizing all of these bandwidths in the order they occur in the data 003ow is presented in Table 11 Data Flow Block Bandwidth Units INSTRUMENT INPUT FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps Formatter FPGA Bandwidth 328 Mbps Flash-memory Write Bandwidth 104 Mbps TRANSMITTER OUTPUT Flash-memory Read Bandwidth 866 Mbps FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps FPGA Serializer Bandwidth 168 Mbps Table 11  Bandwidth summary In order to support our study signal integrity analysis was performed on the portions of the data 003ow affected by physical delays including into and out of the 003ash-memory and from the FPGA to the front panel These physical interfaces are robust enough to support high data throughput rates The ISM is capable of interfacing to an instrument with up to 104 Mbps of continuous data throughput and is capable of 12 


sourcing data to a transmitter at a bandwidth up to 168 Mbps This allows data to be stored to the ISM during the orbital encounter period and downlinked periodically as communications are available R EFERENCES  223R T AX-S/SL RadT olerant FPGAs 224 Actel Corporation Mountain View CA 2008 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/products/milaero/rtaxs/docs.aspx  223Prototyping R T AX-S Using Axcelerator Devices,\224 2003 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/techdocs/appnotes/rtaxs.aspx  223K9XXG08XXM Datasheet 2G x 8 Bit  4G x 8 Bit  8G x 8 Bit NAND Flash Memory,\224 Samsung Electronics 2007  223UT54A CS164245S/SE Schmitt CMOS 16-bit Bidirectional MultiPurpose Transceiver Datasheet,\224 Aero\003ex Corporation Colorado Springs CO 2009 Available http://aero\003ex.com/ams/pagesproduct/prodshirel-16bitlogic.cfm B IOGRAPHY  John Dickinson is a Research Engineer at Southwest Research Institute Having studied Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with a focus on control systems and signals he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division He was the lead Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for the WISE and Kepler Mission Unique Boards MUB for which he compiled and integrated the GSE hardware developed the test scripts and wrote and veri\002ed the GSE code He is the Lead Engineer for the JUNO JADE Instrument Processor Board a lowpower RAD-HARD 3U Compact PCI single-board computer that utilizes the Atmel LEON2 SPARC v8 processor and provides direct instrument and spacecraft serial interfaces He has supported integration systems engineering and promotional efforts on a variety of programs and is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology Charlie Howard  a Principal Engineer in the Department of Space Systems at Southwest Research Institute excels as system architect and digital designer with particular expertise in FPGA and ASIC design Mr Howard has 002lled an active role in the hardware/software architecture for the MMS Mass Memory Module MMM and is the designer of the Mass Memory Controller FPGA Mr Howard is the architect and designer of WISE Mission Unique Board MUB the Kepler Command and Telemetry Board CTB and the Orbital Express CTB and provided multiple FPGA designs for OE Kepler WISE and MMS As Kepler CTB lead he incorporated new simulation capabilities allowing the customer to verify advanced features of the Kepler CTB prior to delivery As an ASIC and FPGA designer Mr Howard 002lled roles in RTL design functional and gate level veri\002cation for high reliability systems including space telecom and defense applications His other interests are worst-case timing and signal integrity analyses Steven Torno is an Electrical Engineer at Southwest Research Institute He studied Electrical Engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute for Technology with a focus on digital signal processing and he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division in 2009 He was the Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for a Control and Telemetry Board CTB demo in partnership with ATK Space Systems where he integrated existing GSE hardware with custom test software he wrote and veri\002ed He is currently an Electrical Engineer for the Robotic Lander Test Bed project working on the Low Voltage Power Supply LVPS board He is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio 13

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
