 The Recent Decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court Concerning Data Retention  Christoph Luetge Technical University of Braunschweig Bienroder Weg 80, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany Christoph@Luetge.de  Abstract In March 2008, the German Federal Constitutional Court \(GFCC\ has passed an important, even though preliminary, decision con cerning data retention. The GFCC s decision accepts the storage of data, but greatly restricts their use to serious offenses like 
murder and organized crime From an ethical point of view, it is particularly interesting to look at the justification given by the GFCC, which relies heavily on the argument that the impartiality Unbefangenheit\ of communication will be thoroughly damaged if feelings of being watched spread in a society. This argument is examined in view of two contrasting theoretical approaches: Discourse ethics and evolutionary contractarian theory  1. Introduction  In March 2008, the German Federal Constitutional Court \(GFCC\ has passed an important decision 
concerning data retention. This decision is a preliminary one, but it can reasonably be anticipated that the court s final decision, expected not before the end of 2008, will not be much different. It is an exceptionally rare occurrence for the GFCC to stop a law in a preliminary decision. And as the general subject of data retention is a very important one internationally, it is worthwhile to look at the major arguments used in this case First, I will describe the general legal setting and 
framework for the German Law on Data Retention which goes back to a European Union directive sections 2 and 3\I will then deal with the court s decision in section 4, looking at the arguments in detail in section 5. Sections 6 and 7 are concerned with the theoretical background of the argument. While section 6 sketches and eventually criticizes a Habermasian discourse ethics background, section 7 tries to find a better suited theoretical b ackground for the GFCC s argument in evolutionary contractarian theory. The 
paper ends with a conclusion 2. The 2006 European Union Directive on Data Retention  Following terrorist attacks like those of September 2001 in New York and March 2004 in Madrid, many voices within the European Union \(EU\aw a need for greater possibilities of communication data retention concerning cell phones, internet usage, emails, fax and sms. There was a long discussion about whether an EU directive could be passed by the European Council alone or whether it required the consent of the European Parliament. Eventually, in December 2005 
the European Parliament voted for the directive with a majority of 378 \(of 605 seats The EU Council was however not unanimous with regard to the directive. Especially Ireland and Slovakia were \(and still are\orically opposed to it. So the usual unanimous vote could not be reached. The EU Council therefore declared the directive not a rule aiming at better criminal prosecution, but a new regulation for competition in the communication sector in the EU member states. Such regulations do not require unanimous consent of all states. Consequently 
in February 2006, the EU Council passed a majority vote for the new directive, which now bears the name EU Directive 2006/24/EG  Ireland has already gone to the European Court of Justice, claiming that the new directive is in fact not just a rule regulating competition, but a rule for criminal prosecution and therefore could only have been passed with unanimous consent of all EU member states. As of June 2008, the European Court s decision 
is however still due  3. The 2007 German Law on Data Retention  There had already been several attempts in Germany to pass a law on data retention during the last 10-15 years. In 1997, the Kohl administration rejected an initiative put forward by the Bundesrat, the second Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE 
 


 chamber of the German Parliament. The federal government itself regarded a wide-ranging collection of data unconstitutional. Also, in the aftermath of September 2001, several more attempts had been launched, but none of them was successful until the EU took action After the EU Directive 2006/24/EG had been passed, the member states were required to put it into national law until September 2007. In April 2007, the German Government presented a new law on undercover criminal prosecution, which incorporated major parts of the EU directive. This law was passed by the German Parliament in November 2007 and became effective by January 1 st 2008 The new law bears the name Gesetz zur Neuregelung der Telekommunikationsberwachung und anderer verdeckter Ermittlungsmanahmen sowie zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie 2006/24/EG Law concerning a new regulation of telecommunication surveillance and other undercover criminal prosecution and for implementing the directive 2006/24/EG\ill henceforth call it simply the German Law on Data Retention \(GLDR This law basically requires all telecommunication providers to store their connections data for at least six and for a maximum of seven months. These data include in particular In the case of phone, cell phone and internet phone communication: the telephone numbers \(or IP addresses\ of the calling and the called party, start and end time of the connection, the use of special communication services \(like conference calls\ and the use of radio cells, thus allowing for geographically locating communicating parties In the case of email communication: the time and IP addresses of sender and receiver, both when a message is sent and when it is collected from a mailbox In the case of Internet usage: IP addresses of the users, start and end time of the connection  The GLDR does however not allow the storage of contents of communication  The GLDR originally allowed for these data to be used for a number of purposes 1\or all kinds of criminal prosecution 2\e defense against significant dangers to public security 3\For the \(non-specified\use of the German intelligence agencies 4\For getting information about telecommunication users in general \( 113 TKG telecommunication law  While the GLDR allowed only state authorities to make use of the data, private parties could however have filed a case of any kind that concerns offenses that were committed with the aid of telecommunication, and then have looked at the inquiry files. In particular, this would have included copyright infringements in file sharing networks The purposes for which the GLDR could have been used were practically all-encompassing. The vast majority of offenses are committed making at least a phone call or sending an email. Moreover, even the smallest offenses like parking tickets could have led to telecommunication surveillance according to this law Thus the new law would have set very low standards for the use of private communication data  4. The GFCC s Decision  In December 2007, a constitutional complaint against the GLDR was filed. For the first time since the Federal Republic exists, a constitutional complaint was backed by more than 30,000 people. As this number was too large to verify all the mandates, eventually eight complaints were filed On 03/19/2008, the GFCC decided that while the practice of data retention was not to be stopped completely, the use of the data collected was severely rest  1\The data may only be given to criminal prosecution authorities, not to any other parties like private companies 2\The data may only be used with permission by a judge, not just by decision of any local police authority 3\ The most important restriction is that the data may only be used for the prosecution of severe offenses. There is a list which states what offenses are considered as severe ones in this regard and the GFCC has made it clear that it believes even this list to be too extensive. Included in this list are murder and homicide, but also tax fraud, economic subsidy fraud and falsification of documents. The list is thus quite extensive, but it rules out the use for all kinds of criminal prosecution, or simply getting data about users for a company s purpose, or the totally unspecified use for virtually unlimited intelligence purposes  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 
 


 The decision is a preliminary one  Eilentscheidung hich is highly unusual for the GFCC. There have been only very few cases where the GFCC has preliminary stopped a law or at least major parts of it. And the judges have explicitly stated that there are very tight conditions for such a decision Moreover, in the case of the GLDR, these conditions are themselves even more strict because the EU directive on data retention requires EU member states to have some national legislation in this regard Nevertheless, the judges of the GFCC decided it necessary to stop the full impact of this law. This preliminary decision remains effective until a final decision will be issued which is expected not before the end of 2008  5. The GFCC s Arguments  In its decision, the GFCC has made use of mainly three arguments which are however intertwined: There is a general danger to the individual personality, there is the specific danger that the impartiality of communication Unbefangenheit der Kommunikation gets lost by allowing for farreaching data surveillance, and there is a danger that completely uninvolved persons will be put under surveillance without sufficient suspicious facts. I will discuss these arguments in turn, starting with the last one  5.1. The Argument about the Danger to Uninvolved Persons  This argument is a rather common one. The GFCC believes that the information retrieval is a fundamental and irreversible intrusion into basic rights, especially as it enables authorities to monitor communication behavior and social contacts not only of a suspect, but necessarily of other persons as well. The GFCC states that it is unavoidable that other people, who are completely unrelated to the offenses under investigation, are subject to the same measures as suspects  5.2. The Argument about the Danger to Personality  The GFCC states that the GLDR poses a general threat to citizens personality. Retaining data on a massive scale without giving specific reasons implies that nearly every citizen is affected. The GFCC regards this as a considerable threat to the right to privacy found in article 10 of the Basic Constitutional Law  Grundgesetz   5.3. The Argument about the Impartiality of Communication  The GFCC, however, goes on to specify what the danger to personality consists in. The court argues that the massive data retention envisaged by the GLDR threatens to shatter both the impartiality of communication Unbefangenheit des Kommunikationsaustauschs as well as the general confidence in the inaccessibility of telecommunication facilities and data Vertrauen in den Schutz der Unzugnglichkeit der Telekommunikationsanlagen insgesamt  These are two separate parts of the argument. With regard to the first one impartiality is however only an imperfect translation of Unbefangenheit which rather means speaking freely and without a feeling of being spied on The second part of the argument assumes that there is a general feeling among citizens that their telecommunication data are inaccessible. This is quite a strong assumption and it could be argued that this feeling is already gone to a large part. But still, the GFCC can be interpreted as aiming at preventing these feelings to erode even further   6. Communication in a Discourse Ethics Perspective  On what theoretical grounds should the impartiality of communication be such an important thing? One answer is given in the discourse ethics of J. Habermas which relies heavily on the way free communication is allowed in a society. A society can, according to Habermas, remain stable only if citizens are motivated by something beyond pure self-interest. This needs further explication One of Habermas major arguments is that the participants of a discourse must allow their behavior  at least partially to be motivated by a rational motivation  5 ith th e h e lp of this co n c ept  Habermas explicates the difference between his two opposing types of actions: strategic and communicative. This difference represents a central antagonism in Habermas theory. While strategic action strategisches Handeln ffected by Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 
 


 incentives and sanctions, communicative action  kommunikatives Handeln by rational motivation. But what, then, is rational motivation and where does it come from It is difficult to find an answer to this question in Habermas writings e s i m p l y pos tulates   If arguments are valid, the insight into the internal conditions of their validity can have rationally motivating force vol. 1, p. 54; my translation\ Also Habermas admits that the concept of a rational motivation has not yet been analyzed satisfactorily In later works, the situation does not get much better. In e n ece ssit y o f a ratio n a l m o tiv at ion i s  stressed several time 68, 82, 11 9 t on l y i n  one instance a justification is given. Here, Habermas relies on the illocutionary effects of a speech act. He assumes that speech acts can force actors to perform certain actions and refrain from others. The core of this assumption is the idea of a performative contradiction  pp 100f  ccordin g to Haberm as a ration a l l y  motivated actor is led by the desire to avoid a performative contradiction It is doubtful whether it makes sense to assume such a binding force of a speech act. It seems as if Habermas recognizes this problem himself: He invents a dialogue with a fictitious sceptic who doubts exactly this binding force of speech acts. However, Habermas responds that the sceptic may well stick to his position but then has to be silent He cannot escape the Lebenswelt which according to Habermas is formed by cultural tradition and socialization which in turn work through rational motivation. If he tried to escape, he would end in schizophrenia and suicide   p. 1 12; m y tra n s l a tion   In the 1990s, Habermas thought develops in new directions. The problem of the sceptic is taken on again in as at f i rs t s e e m s to w e ak e n t h e  power of rational motivation by attributing to moral norms only the weak motivating power of good reasons  y  tran slation  g o es a s  f a r a s  stating that the validity of moral norms is subject to the condition that they are observed as the basis of a general practice  13 6; m y trans l atio n  thu s  implying that individuals might be allowed to behave immorally when faced with possible exploitation by others. This would be the case in prisoners dilemma PD\ations. However, in the rest of this article Habermas makes it clear that he does not consider this a problem of ethics. Rather, he writes, it can only be argued within the discourse of law that some norms might be valid but yet not reasonable zumutbar  because of their lack of general acceptance Consequently, this leads Habermas to include institutions in his conception, which were rather neglected in his earlier work. He recognizes that the problem of compliance to norms cannot be solved by postulates of rational motivation or by citing developmental psychology. In h e ex plicitl y  develops an account of law and institutions. However even here it soon becomes clear that he does not rely on sanctions and incentives alone as a means for governing modern societies. Rather, the citizens must still have certain characteristics: They have to accept  not only the legal rules, but also normative claims resulting in turn from the idealized discourse assumptions. Habermas still assumes a coordination of plans of actions   y la n g u a g e  thus still assuming the existence of rational motivation working via speech acts. Thus Habermas main claims are still intact in his second, institutional, phase Now the question mentioned above become relevant: Can rational motivation beyond self-interest remain stable in view of opposing incentives Regarding Habermas argument concerning speech acts, one problem is his reconstruction of the Lebenswelt In my view, there are alternative, and less harmonious, reconstructions of the Lebenswelt possible in which the binding force of speech acts is much weaker. One major example is the gametheoretic approach that reconstructs all human interactions as being riddled with dilemma situations like the prisoners dilemma. These situations can be either manifest \(as in open market interactions with competition being obvious\ or hidden. Hidden PD situations that have been overcome are exemplified prominently in all the institutions, like police and jurisdiction, that come into effect as a consequence of the social contract which enables the actors to escape from the natural state \(i.e., a PD situation\. And approaches like Binmore s  s i g n th e P D a central role for ethics In a phenomenalistic perspective that does not look beyond the surface, however, it looks as if the individuals which act according to these institutions have been moved by a rational motivation. However in another perspective, the deeper structures behind become visible and it becomes clear that it is not just rational motivation, but rather \(in this case, informal incentives and possible sanctions that hold this social practice in place. This casts doubt on Habermas claim to have found the only reconstruction of everyday practices Moreover, while Habermas as I have shown  introduces institutions into his conception in later works, thus allowing for sanctioning by legal rules, he Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


 still relies on his original idea of rationally motivated individuals. Law and institutions are therefore assigned only a secondary place  7. How the GFCC s Third Argument Might Be Reconstructed  Of course, communication is not impartial in the sense that we can be completely unbiased, free from external constraints and not under external pressure of any kind. This would be a much too far-reaching conclusion However, I think the third argument does not rest solely on a discourse ethics basis, but can be made sense of in another perspective. Impartial communication does not have to be related to a rational motivation but can be reconstructed on a basis of pure self-interest It is to the advantage of all involved if people can communicate impartially. Or, more precisely: It is a loss of well-being for all involved if communication gets less impartial which does not require it to be totally impartial But less impartial communication can destroy necessary empathy. And this concept of empathy has been thoroughly analyzed in Ken Binmore s Game Theory and the Social Contract  Binmore has proposed an evolutionary contractarian approach which he calls naturalistic as it relies heavily both on game-theoretic and on sociobiological concepts. A central demand of Binmore s naturalism is: No commitments! I will discuss this first and then elaborate on Binmore s concept of empathetic preferences which are supposed to be necessary for social stability in modern societies. However, as I will try to show, these empathetic preferences are fundamentally different from the rational motivation discussed so far Binmore emphasizes that a naturalistic approach must abandon all authorities legitimated by metaphysics. According to him, the vast majority of contemporary approaches in political philosophy  among them, Rawls, Harsanyi, Gauthier and Nozick  give metaphysical justifications for rules and institutions. The common idea of these approaches is that actors can make commitments Binmore defines a commitment as an action in the present that binds the person who makes it irrevocably in the future  161  A co m m i t m e n t is t h u s a  binding unilateral promise ibid.\ise that ultimately cannot be revoked and therefore is neither nor has to be enforced by sanctions, but can obviously be secured in some alternative way The major problem in assuming the possibility of commitments is the construction of a plausible mechanism of enforcement \(cf 16 2 on e relies exclusively on self-interest. It is difficult to commit oneself as well as convincing others that one has committed oneself. One possible solution is to provide \(financial hostages For example, a company that has made a commitment to environmental protection may sign a contract in which they commit themselves to paying a fixed amount of money if the commitment is broken. And there are other, more subtle, mechanisms of securing commitments via reputation mechanisms. These are, however commitments that are enforced via sanctions, and not the kind of commitments that political philosophers like those mentioned above have in mind Binmore proposes a different concept: empathetic preferences. This goes back to Harsanyi s extended sympathy preferences cf e m plo y i n g t h e  concept of empathetic preferences Binmore wants to highlight the difference between the classic concept of sympathy in D. Hume s works and his modern one Cf 28 58f f ch 4.3 1 an d [2], ch 2  5.4   The intuitive idea behind this is that even a homo oeconomicus actor can adapt his actions better to that of other actors if he can predict their behavior Moreover, Binmore distinguishes sharply between a sympathetic and an empathetic preference An actor A reveals a sympathetic preference, if it can be deduced from his behavior that he puts himself into actor B s position and adopts B s preferences \(cf  p 286  By con t ras t actor A rev eals an e m pa th et ic  preference, if it can be deduced from his behavior that he puts himself into actor B s position without taking on B s preferences. In this case, A sticks to his own preferences. He can still compare his preferences to B s and evaluate or criticize the latter. To cite Binmore s example I would rather be Eve eating an apple than Adam wearing a fig leaf  90  Binmore argues that the ability to empathize, and not the ability to sympathize with others is what makes a human being. He speculates about the evolutionary history of this ability which may have been advantageous for coordinating behavior in huntergatherer societies \(cf 57 an d 288ff  A n d he  distinguishes between three time horizons in which empathetic preferences play a role: short, medium, and long run In the short run, the personal preferences of an actor as well as her empathetic preferences are fixed i.e., the actor empathizes in exactly the way her Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 
 


 empathetic preferences prescribe and deliberates morally in this way. Here, moral norms are conventions, which work as short cuts for long economic calculations. While morals do not play a role on the level of the social contract framework, they do influence the individuals actions within this framework. Morals are functional in the short run \(cf  4 6.8   In the long run, all preferences, personal and empathetic, are subject to change, as the actor adapts to new situations and new rules. Here, new social contracts are negotiated and existing ones modified The personal and empathetic preferences adapt to these new situations. It is interesting to see that in the long run, all moral content erodes out of the preferences Over longer periods time, the actors arrive via moral empathy at the same result as if they had been bargaining straightaway all the time. Binmore makes it clear that in the long run morals serve long-run interests, and, more importantly, no moral norms can remain stable that are systematically opposed to incentives Finally, in the medium run, the personal preferences remain fixed while the empathetic ones may change. According to Binmore, evolution will bring the latter into empathy equilibrium  p. 6 5  Cf. also ibid., ch. 1.2.7, 1.3, and pp. 290ff.\ which all actors have equal empathetic preferences. It is already in this situation as in the long run that all moral content erodes from the social contract framework. The actors end up with a result identical to a Nash bargaining equilibrium \(Cf d [11  However, this is at variance with the actors own impression: Due to the semantics employed, they still think that they are guided by moral deliberation in the traditional sense. Binmore consequently regards the ability to empathize as at least partially genetically hard-wired  13 3 an d 2], p  18 2  The difference between the long and medium run is that in the medium run, evolution has not had enough time to shape personal preferences and adapt them to new environments and situations. By distinguishing between the three time horizons, Binmore defines the role of empathetic preferences in society: They are used for coordination, or more precisely: for reforming existing social contracts and consenting to new ones They are used as a heuristic tool for finding directions in which new social contracts may develop. In this sense, Binm reg a rds th e e m pat h etic  preferences as an important part of morality  Can empathetic preferences be regarded as being on the same level as Habermas rational motivation? I think not, for the following reasons Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that empathetic preferences have fewer consequences for their bearers. In Habermas works, one gets the impression that he already has in mind a rather precise idea how the citizens should act or at least which rules they should adopt. In addition, he shows clear traces of an opposition to approaches that rely on self-interest for their implementation This impression does not arise when reading Binmore. First, the empathetic preferences exhibit a peculiar quality: Assuming their existence does not preclude anything for the detailed design of rules and institutions. If A can put herself in B s position, she will in some way try to assess B: On the one hand, if A regards B as rather unreliable or as only interested in short-run gains, she will anticipate B s defection, adapt her own behavior and tend to counter-defect preemptively herself \(cf on t h e oth e r h a n d  A regards B as reliable and if there are no contrary incentives for A to defect, A will tend to cooperate But this is an open-end process the result of which cannot be precluded by the philosopher Second, and more important to my mind, the ability to empathize cannot be exploited by other actors Consider this: If A constrains her behavior in a PD situation, e.g., by subscribing to a rational motivation or a sense of justice, she risks being exploited by B This can only be avoided if B constrains his behavior in the same way as A, i.e., by way of sanctions or the like. But if A can just empathize with B in a PD situation, i.e., relies on empathetic preferences, she does not necessarily risk exploitation, especially not in a situation where B acts in ways different from A. To take an example: Suppose that one of the two prisoners in the classic PD situation \(X\ motivated by a sense of justice. If the other \(Y\nows this but is not motivated in this way himself, he can exploit X without any problem by confessing \(i.e. defecting\t if X only has empathetic preferences, this does not necessarily lead to exploitation. It would only mean that X might anticipate the reaction of Y to his own moral behavior. X could, e. g., use this knowledge to try to turn the tables and exploit Y. In any case, Y cannot gain any unilateral advantage from knowing that X has adopted empathetic preferences, as Y would have to count on the fact that X would anticipate this  by empathizing with Y   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 
 


 Therefore, the ability to empathize is different from Habermas rational motivation discussed above. It does not preclude any particular action, and it cannot be exploited. And, what is most important for my argument at hand, it makes the impartiality of communication a strong asset for a society. If this impartiality is endangered or severely restrained empathizing with one another becomes much more difficult. So there is an argument for promoting the impartiality of communication without relying on more than self-interest   8. Conclusion  I have tried to analyze the theoretical background for the GFCC s decision to preliminary stop major parts of the German Law on Data Retention. The decision rests to a great part on the argument that there is such a thing as the impartiality of communication which is indispensable for a society This argument seems to have its roots in discourse theory, with its focus on uninhibited communication. I have argued, however, that discourse ethics assumes a rational motivation beyond self-interest, and that it is very doubtful that this rational motivation can remain stable in situations like the prisoners dilemma This does not imply, however, that another theoretical basis of the GFCC s argument could not be found. One candidate for this basis is Binmore s evolutionary contractarian approach. It does not assume any kind of rational motivation, but just standard self-interest. It however regards the ability to empathize with others as a crucial ability for a society And thus the impartiality of communication is in fact important and worthy of judicial protection, not only in Germany    References  1 B i nm or e  K   199 4 G a m e T h e o r y a nd the Soc i a l  Contract: Vol. 1: Playing Fair, Cambridge, Mass., London MIT Press  2 B i nm or e  K   199 8 G a m e T h e o r y a nd the Soc i a l  Contract: Vol. 2: Just Playing, Cambridge, Mass., London MIT Press  3 B V e rfG 1 B v R 25 6/0 8 v o m 11 3 20 08 A b s a tz N r 1 188 http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen rs20080311_1bvr025608.html  4 H a be rm a s J  198 1 h e o rie de s k o m m unik a tiv e n  Handelns, 2 Bde., Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp \(engl.: Theory of Communicative Action, Boston 1984   Hab e rm as J 1 9 8 3  19 99  Di sku r set h i k  No t i z en zu einem Begrndungsprogramm, in: Moralbewutsein und kommunikatives Handeln, Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 53-125  6 H a be rm as J  1991 r l u t e r ung e n z u r D i s k urs e thik  Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp  7 H a be rm a s J  1992 k tiz it  t und G e ltung Be itr g e z u r Diskurstheorie des Rechts und des demokratischen Rechtsstaats, Frankfurt/M. \(engl.: Between Facts and Norms Contributions to a Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy Cambridge, Mass. 1996  8 H a rs a n y i J  C  197 7 a tio n a l B e ha v i or a nd B a rg a i ning Equilibrium in Games and Social Situations, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge  9 L u e t g e C  20 05 Ec on om ic  Ethic s  B u s i ne s s Ethic s  a n d  the Idea of Mutual Advantages, Business Ethics: A European Review 14, no. 2, pp. 108-118  10 N a s h J  1 95 0 uili bri u m Points i n N P e rs on G a m e s   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 36, 48-49  11 N a s h J  19 51 T h e B a rga i ning  P r o b le m  Ec onom e t rica 18, 155-162   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


Update Once new route plans have been devised verify them and upload them to vehicles via their M2M connection. Additional information such as firmware upgrades can also be transmitted if and when necessary Act On board the vehicle, whenever new scheduling is received, locally stored information is updated to inform the driver of re-planning. If the container has an RFID scanner installed, a scan of current freight will be compared against the new schedule to verify compliance. If other data, e.g firmware upgrades, are received, they are installed automatically In particular, during the deliberation phase, route optimization and the derivation of schedules can directly use both information relating to vehicles movements as they proceed through delivery schedules and feedback from RFID transponders notifying when orders have been added to or removed. This real-time component implies that time windows can be more finely tuned according to current events, resulting in alternative schedules that can either compensate for delays or take advantage of time saved. Preliminary results with a prototype demonstrate that employing real-time data in the optimization process can further reduce transportation operating costs by up to 3 beyond the 5-10% achieved from the standard optimization process described earlier - depending on the particular business case, order structure and system configuration  5. Challenges and Conclusions  There remain many scientific and practical challenges related to the design and use of real-time dispatching and optimizatio n systems. A selection of these we consider as relevant to LS/ATN and for consideration by the community at large are as follows A major challenge is the effective handling of intercompany, inter-region and inter-modal transportation Transportation intrinsically involves multiple carriers operating both within and across sectors \(i.e., road, air and shipping\ and across geographical boundaries Each carrier has their own, often proprietary, systems that do not necessarily integrate easily with one another. Addressing this integration problem is a significant engineering issue to be faced as the technologies addressed in this article come into more widespread use The integration of transportation planners into supply chain and production systems is also important As previously mentioned, freight is now often delivered directly to manufacturing plants without passing through transitional storage. Integration of these systems thus becomes a priority when shaping dynamic supply chains, and supply networks OBUs in use today typically consist of a simple processor, memory and communication interfaces Installed software is often designed solely for reading data from sensors and transmitting it to the TMS. One method of improving on this design is the integration of an autonomous software controller into the OBU to assist with the manipulation and coordination of collected on-board data. Example uses include assisting in the selection of M2M connection type in a multi-provider environment according to the type and volume of data to be transmitted and caching data locally if connections are temporarily unavailable. The controller can be further extended with a software agent that extends the distributed intelligence offered by the TMS optimizer. This agent essentially acts as a remote extension of the optimization platform allowing the agent to act as a proxy representative of the vehicle itself within the context of route scheduling. Vehicles can thus become active participants in the planning process, forming a network overlay of communicating data processors Further research is required on so-called smart  freight containers capable of announcing their presence and even negotiating with external devices. For example, a simple OBU fixed to a container will allow it to communicate with vehicles, customs checks and equipment at freight consolidation centers. Many major transportation companies use such centers, distributed at strategic locations, with the primary goal of consolidating freight onto as few vehicles as possible to maximize use of available capacity. With the installation of RFID readers, incoming freight with RFID tags can be traced as it moves through a facility providing TMS optimizers with complete coverage of freight location throughout its entire lifecycle within the business chain In addition, external factors also favor early adoption of pervasive technologies, such as the ongoing escalation of fuel prices and constant increases in demand for fast, high-volume freight shipping. This is recognized in the European Union white paper European Transport Policy for 2010  h ic h discusses the use of intelligent information services integrated with route planning systems and mobile communications to provide real-time, intelligent endto-end freight and vehicle tracking and tracing There can be little doubt that the adoption of intelligent transportation planners capable of using real-time data sourced from pervasive technologies such as those discussed in this article is a major objective of many freight transportation operators both in Europe and other areas of the world. With these techniques now widely recognized as an important Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


means of reducing operating costs, many companies are already well advanced on the path to adoption  6.

The fact that the genotypes have been generated by recombination makes it very hard to close the set of bases by intersection. As mentioned before, haplotype inference studies usually select data from blocks where recombination probability is almost 0, so the instances in our experiments with recombination level 4, 16 and 40 are not even realistic but were tested because they are a kind of standard in the literature The results of the non-uniform instances are shown in table IV. Non-uniform instances are a little harder than uniform instances. Taking into consideration the number haplotypes generated by each preprocessing method we can see that the difference gets bigger as the problem size grows being zero or almost 0 for the smallest instances. It is also worth noticing that the time spent by the tabu search when data is preprocessed with the set-based preprocessing is lower than that of the RTIP preprocessing for 78 of the 90 instances The hapmap instances are considered hard; the execution 


information of all of them is shown in table V. The number of sites of the hapmap instances is denoted by the last two characters of the name of the instance and the number of genotypes varies between 5 and 68. Only one of the 24 instances is aborted because it exceeds the given time limit Experiments show that is the same instance that SHIP and RPoly abort. Although the execution time is not reduced for every instance, the total time for the 21 solved instances with RTIP-based preprocessing is 558 seconds and the total preprocessing time using set-based procedure \(note that 23 or 24 instances are solved reducing the search space, the time needed for the tabu search is reduced for all except three instances \(note that this process is non-deterministic Our proposed preprocessing method makes a difference between aborting an instance and computing it in a  TABLE V HAPMAP INSTANCES RTIP based preprocessing Set based preprocessing haplotypes # haploty pes  haplo types Prepr.

For small instances RTIP-based method is usually quicker and the number of haplotypes generated is almost the same as the number of haplotypes generated by the RTIP-based procedure. This is a deterministic process so execution times are quite similar Although the tabu search process was firstly implemented to test the preprocessing procedures it has proved to be an effective algorithm for the HIPP problem. The refinement process in the intensification phase is probably the strongest procedure in the tabu search; this is the procedure that, in most cases, returns the optimal solution Table V shows the result of the total number of instances solved by our algorithm another five solvers, which can be found in the reference section. Our algorithm, which was implemented in Java, was tested with a time limit of 10,000 seconds on a MacBook 2.1 with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor up to 2.16GHz and 3GB RAM, although, JVM  s maximum heap size \(on Mac OS X five solvers were tested by Lin  e and Marques-Silva  [10 with a time limit of 10,000 seconds, using a 1.9GHz Athlon XP. However, using different machines to test the solver does not mean that the number of solved instances can be increased, since, when solved, the executions of our algorithm never took longer than 4 minutes  VI. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a new preprocessing algorithm for the HIPP problem coupled with a tabu search. This new preprocessing is based on manipulating subsets of haplotypes instead of haplotype units. The experimental results show that in the hardest instances this new preprocessing step can dramatically decrease the time spent by the whole algorithm \(preprocessing + tabu search fact is due to the reduction in the search space provoked by the new preprocessing. On the other hand, the new preprocessing does not work properly in instances with recombination. However, we can think about the two proposed preprocessing algorithm as complementary procedures, because the weaknesses of the set-based procedure \(recombination and small instances solved by the RTIP-based procedure As mentioned before, our aim was to develop a new preprocessing method to deal with large problem instances but, since the implemented tabu search has proved to be an effective algorithm, new functionalities should be developed  VII.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
