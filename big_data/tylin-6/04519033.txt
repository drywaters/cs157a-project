As the situations change very often and extensively today is to deliver good grownups to our customers to serve them the role of a user becomes increasingly important because it is he or Software industries did the same she who really can understand the current situation and make decisions to cope with it A user cannot operate 
machines or systems But it was soon made clear that developing software that adequately if they cannot trust it But formerly machines and way is too much unrealistic and Al technology taught them systems are very simple so that a user can expect how it would that prototyping is not just one of the steps before delivery behave But increasing complexity and diversification makes it more but you can grow your product function while in serve if you and more difficult Software introduced the idea of continual introduce continual prototyping prototyping and by evolving its functions step by step to a higher 
level after a user gets accustomed to it and build up trust in it This One of the features of software is that you cannot see paper points out that if we recall that most of the systems today are what it is or how it works until you use it Even if software is the combination of hardware and software we might as well 100 completed before delivery customers would still feel introduce the concept of continual prototyping into hardwareuneasy because they cannot see how it works dominant systems This would serve for a customer to build up trust more easily 
so that it is expected he or she can make decisions better Continual prototyping changed the whole scene Software and respond quicker and better As hardware is physical it has life industries stopped delivering grownups and instead they But software is non-physical so that it is eternal If we consider that moved toward growing babies together with their decommissioning of software is becoming a very big problem we customers Babies are simple so that customers can easily may utilize the phenomenon of deterioration as an indicator of the understand them As they grow older customers learn remaining life Thus if we 
put advantages of software and hardware together with them together we may come up with a system which will cancel the disadvantages each other so that it will increase user's confidence In fact the growing function curve of software is quite similar to our positive learning curve Once customers Keywords trust hardware system frequent and extensive understand how our babies would behave then they are ready situational changes adaptability flexibility continualprototyping if some new functions are added on because they know that their babies would behave as they expect They grow trust as their babies grow I INTRODUCTION 
When it comes to hardware their product development With increasing diversification and complexities style is still very much traditional Hardware is being customers are getting more and more frustrated and anxious produced with fixed function Their increasing complexities because they cannot see how the system works As Donald and diversification drives our customers more and more Norman pointed out in his book Emotional Design 1 uneasy simple mechanical objects can be trusted if only because But if we change our way of hardware product their behavior is so simple that our expectations are apt to be development and adopt the same style 
as the one in software accurate He also points out that the problems of current a great amount of our customers concern or uneasiness objects are that you don't know what to expect would be removed This paper points out that if we introduce continual In the case of hardware 20 of our customers used to buy prototyping into our system development these issues if not our products as soon as they appeared on the market 80 all but most of them certainly may be solved others could follow suit if their reputation was good But The way of software development 
changed remarkably nowadays product life cycle is getting shorter and shorter since the emergence of knowledge engineering or Al and before these 200 can establish their product reviews technology It changed the way of thinking in software products are replaced by another model or by a new product technology Until then software was developed in the same So we don't have any lighthouse now What we have to way as hardware Hardware is still being developed in the provide to our customers is a lighthouse showing their way same old style i.e with the fixed function Their philosophy Continual prototyping would throw light into the hardware 978-1 4244-2 150-3/08/$25.OO 2512008 IEEE 


market In fact all systems are now combination of hardware and software and it would not be too much to say that there is no system which is composed of hardware alone Then it would be quite natural to introduce continual prototyping into l_l our hardware system development We will discuss in this paper how continual prototyping may be introduced into hardware development in order for the customer to see or expect how the developed system 000L will behave Characteristics of Natural Product Functions II DEVELOPMENT OFPrdcFutin HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE Resources Fig.2 Hardware development A Hardware development But software development on the other hand is from Hardware is produced with the fixed function as shown scratch There is no such pre-existing material Creating a in Fig 1 functional pattern of the requirement is the task Fig.3 Design Degradation Function Restore Production Maintenance in Use Product Functions Shipping Fig.3 Software development Hardware Delivery of Finished Product In short hardware development is to process what nature produced Fig.4 while software development is to produce Fig 1 Hardware development material from the start and process it Fig.5 Software used to be produced in the same way as hardware But as requirements become more and more stringent and complex it becomes very much difficult to produce software in the same way as hardware Hardware development is nothing other than processing or Processing manufacturing of the already existing natural resources Therefore the core task of hardware development is to Material change or adapt material characteristics to the requirements Product It is to match the characteristic pattern of a material and that of functional requirements as shown in Fig.2 Fig 4 Hardware development 


might not be able to cope with the quickly increasing demand for software because software has to be developed from nothing Knowledge engineering or Al technology helped us get over the crisis It introduced the concept of continual prototyping as shown in Fig.8 A Irr Creation Customizing function Product Function Fig.5 Software development Ship ing Use Thus software development takes more time and efforts and we cannot tell easily what will come out In hardware material is already there so you can see or expect what Software you can get Fig.6 The big issue of software is you cannot Continuous Prototyping see or expect until your system is finished Fig.7 Fig 8 Software development Material Product With the introduction of continual prototyping software Characteristics Behavior can be delivered with the minimum function at first and let its function grow with time after it is shipped But since the core See of software development is adaptation it is more appropriate Expect to describe the function evolves with time rather than it grows with time To achieve higher level of adaptation more and more pieces of software are coming to be combined Another Fig.6 Hardware visibility reason is because as we produce material from the first in the case of software development it takes too much time and efforts so that it is unrealistic to start everything from the first It is far better to combine existing pieces together to produce new functions to adapt to the changing extent or level of Product Behavior requirements See B Advantages and disadvantages Fig.7 Software visibility Hardware has such an advantage over software in terms of development as you don't worry too much about its visibility of functions The functions you are developing In other words hardware development can be compared to are more visible or at least it is easier to expect to how it the growth of an individual living thing Hardware will behave People used to trust hardware more because they development is to grow each individual physical entity so that felt they could expect their behaviors more easily than it will match the requirements Software development on the software other hand is more of a problem of adaptation To adapt better we have to think as species Hardware discusses the The core of software development is combination So you problems of John and Smith while software discusses the cannot see or expect how it behaves easily The problem of the human species continual prototyping removed this concern greatly People can use simple functions first and as they get accustomed to it So the fundamental nature of software development is how and as their trust grows software system evolves to next we can produce resources which will adapt to the changing higher level And after the user get accustomed to this level requirements In mid-80's it was very much worried that we and their trust is fully attained then it evolves to the next 


higher level This process is repeated so that people's trust grows proportionally as the function grows But if we consider that extent of hardware usage is intrinsically limited no matter how diversified their use may And the seeming disadvantage turns out to be an advantage be and how much rapid its operating conditions may change for software Today situations change very rapidly and If we can classify user patterns we may be able to prepare extensively so the flexibility or the adaptability becomes very suitable group of add-on's to fit to each case Then continual much important to cope with them People trust increases prototyping can be introduced into hardware development because they can cope with different situations better The traditional advantage of hardware therefore becomes D Decommissioning disadvantage The problem of how we can make our hardware more adaptive to the changing situations becomes Another advantage of hardware is that since it is a physical very important How can we realize this and how can we entity the definition of decommissioning is very much recover trust from our customers in this quickly and straightforward The battle against degradation and the extensively changing world limited life has been very severe and until now it was considered disadvantage But if we recall that III CONTINUAL PROTOTYPING decommissioning is now becoming a very big issue in software the fact that hardware deteriorates a blessing One conceivable solution would be to equip our hardware We can consider deterioration as a signal for system with all kinds of functions from the first and to let the decommissioning functions work which are necessary to respond to the current situation If we embed many IC chips into the hardware In the case of software the increased use of COTS system it would increase adaptability Commercial Off The Shelf makes the definition of decommissioning much more difficult because nobody can But if we were to realize such a system it will come heavy see the whole picture and a designer must prepare a wide variety of sensors beforehand because he or she cannot predict what situations IV COMBINED SYSTEM will take place But if we combine hardware and software adequately to If we introduce continual prototyping into hardware achieve continual prototyping in hardware then hardware development it would be easier to add adaptability to will be an indicator for decommissioning while software will hardware system work for continual prototyping realization Continual prototyping brought user-centric development We can start from a very primitive set of elements and with The development of a system with the fixed function is based the increase of its use time we will add necessary elements upon the idea that a designer can foresee the operating element by element in order to move up to the next higher conditions And based upon this expected operating level If some elements will not be used anymore after a conditions hardware systems have been developed But with certain period of time we can just remove them So if increasing changes and diversifications designers can no adequate combination can be achieved in a hardwarelonger foresee the operating conditions of his or her system dominant system we will be able to decommission a system adequately and we can keep our system consistently light but What software industry realized in mid-80s is the change still keep enough adaptability and flexibility from designer-centric to user-centric development or in other words the changed from one way to interactive development V CONCLUDING REMARK The users trust a system better because they feel what they want is gradually implemented and they have time to learn Traditionally our way of design a system is primary based how they will behave upon the idea of actuation We give commands to machines or systems and they are expected to operate exactly as we Then how can we introduce continual prototyping concept instruct them no matter how the situation might change But into hardware development this is workable because the situation did not change appreciably And what make things easier is that in these C Add-on days machines and systems are very much simple so that users can tell how they would behave The idea of continual prototyping is to add functions onto the present system If we develop hardware with prior But today situations change very often and extensively consideration for add-ons then the function of hardware can and what makes the matter worse is that the requirements are evolve Of course in the case of hardware the realization of very much diversifying So it is getting harder and harder for add-on is not so easy as in software 


a designer to foresee the operating conditions and prepare adequate commands for operation If we recall that it is a user who knows what is happening now then the design of a system moves from the traditional designer-centric to user-centric approach Thus the primary role of a system now is to help a user make adequate decisions at the right time and respond quicker and better In other words a machine or a system must be designed in such a way that it teams well up with a user and works together well To achieve such a goal user's trust is indispensable But increasing complexity and diversification makes such trust building difficult This paper points out that if we introduce the idea of continual prototyping which is popular in software development today into hardware development it will serve to build up user's trust REFERENCE 1 D Norman Emotional Design Why We Love or Hate Everyday Things Basic Books 2005 


 3.1. Agreement among the experts  Table 1. Data acquisition tasks shows all 103 tasks with means and standard deviations for both the panel of technical experts and the panel of legal experts. This table is shown for completeness, but most of the discussion revolves around the tables that follow. Table 2. Correlations between the 10 experts shows correlations between each of the experts for the 103 tasks The average correlation is also shown for both the subset of all other experts and for the subset of experts in the panel that they belong. The correlations range from a low of 0.178 to a high of 0.62. All of the correlations, except the two under 0.2, are significantly different from 0 at a level of significance of .05. Correlations tend to be a little higher among the legal experts than among the technical experts  Table 2.

Top rated tasks shows all tasks with a mean of 3.5 or higher. Although there were no tasks that showed a consistent score of 4 for all members of the combined panel, three tasks had a consistent score of 4 within a given panel. Task 2 was given a score of 4 for each member of the technical panel and a mean score of 3.6 from the members of the legal panel Task 39 was given a score of 4 by each member of the panel of legal experts and a mean score of 3.8 from members of the panel of technical experts. The only other consistent score of 4 by all members of the panel was for task 10, where the mean score for the panel of legal experts was quite a bit less at 3.2 Table 3. Top rated tasks shows a lot of agreement between the two different panels with a mean difference of 0.6 or less for all tasks, except task 10 which has a difference of 0.8  Table 3.

Tables 1 and 3 reveal much similarity between the ratings of tasks between the two panels, but Table 4 Largest technical and legal conflicts features tasks where the two panels rate the same tasks very differently showing conflict between the two panels Tasks 25, 24, 26, 95 and 89 are all rated much higher on average, by the technical panel members than by the legal panel members, with all showing a mean difference of 1.0 or more. Tasks 32, 69, 61, 47 and 68 all are rated much higher, on average, by the legal panel members than by the technical panel members also with all showing a mean difference of 1.0 or more. Table 4. Largest technical and legal conflicts also reports the p-value from a t-test for differences in means. Most of the p-values do not show a significant difference at a usual significance level of 05 because the sample sizes of 5 are very small and also because of conflict within each panel that results in large standard deviations  Table 4.

Table 5. Technical panel conflict examines the dynamics within the Technical panel of experts and shows 18 different tasks that have a standard deviation of more than 1. It is ordered by the magnitude of standard deviation, and it shows the actual ratings from each expert as well There is an extremely large variety of ratings for these tasks. For example, task 28 shows one expert giving a rating of 0 \(i.e., absolutely prohibited\d another giving a rating of 4 \(i.e., absolutely essential\asks 64 and 79 are similar in that they exhibit the same range of responses.  The remaining tasks also show a wide range of ratings among the panel members, varying from either 1 to 4 or from 0 to 3, except for task 13. Task 13 shows three members of the panel with a rating of 2 and the remaining two members agreeing with a rating of 4  Table 5.

Legal panel conflict is similar to Table 5 in that it shows a wide range of tasks that show conflict among members of the panel. It is interesting to note that the two tables overlap with only three tasks, 22, 56 and 64.  The largest range occurred in tasks 82 and 101 where the experts ratings vary from 0 to 4, the largest possible discrepancy. Most of the rest of the tasks show variability in ratings from either 1 to 4 or from 0 to 3.  The only exceptions are tasks 22, 65 and 66  Table 6.

Topics of agreement or conflict  A closer inspection of the task descriptions where the experts largely were in agreement or conflict helps to identify topics where additional clarification is beneficial. Although not problematic, the tasks identified as those with high agreement scores represent tasks where the technical and legal aspects of those tasks are likely to be better understood by the experts. The areas of concern focus on those tasks where conflict scores were highest Two topics are observed as being particularly problematic regarding tasks with high levels of conflict. The first area represents those tasks pertaining to a suspect computer workstation that is running at the time the forensic examiner encounters it. The second area represents those tasks pertaining to disconnecting or removing secondary storage devices other than hard disks. Both of these areas are discussed below Overall, fifteen of the 103 tasks represent conditions dependent upon the computer workstation being either on or off. Tasks 21 through 33 begin with the condition If the computer workstation is powered on and tasks 34 and 35 being with the condition if the computer workstation is powered off First, it is interesting to note that none of these tasks are listed in Table 3. Top rated tasks, as the experts did not reach high levels of agreement on any of these fifteen tasks. More problematic is the high level of conflict that occurred among the tasks within this topic. Six of these tasks had the highest levels of conflict within the panel of technical experts, two tasks had the highest level of conflict within the panel of legal experts, and four of the tasks had the highest level of conflict between the two panels of experts For example, task 22, which states if the computer workstation is powered on and the workstation s monitor is powered on and blank move the mouse to terminate the screen saver  obtained high levels of conflict within both panels of experts. One member of the panel of technical experts and two members of the panel of legal experts indicated that this task was desired, two members of the panel of technical experts and three members of the panel of legal experts indicated that this task was undesired, and two members of the panel of technical experts indicated that this task is absolutely prohibited Additionally, although tasks 24 through 26 concern similar concepts pertaining to gathering information from a computer workstation prior to powering it off, each these three tasks achieved high levels of conflict between the two expert panels while task 24 obtained a high level of conflict within the panel of technical experts and task 26 obtained a high level of conflict within the panel of legal experts Clearly, the experts were not in agreement concerning the performance of tasks when confronting a computer workstation that is powered on. This represents an area where additional information would be helpful to provide a better understanding of best practices among computer forensics practitioners High conflict scores were also observed in the four tasks concerning the topic of disconnecting or removing secondary storage devices other than hard disks; however, it is particularly confounding that three of these tasks are also among those tasks with the highest levels of agreement. Tasks 53, 54, and 55 are listed in Table 3. Top rated tasks, as their mean scores are all 3.5. Also notice that each of these tasks earned consistent scores from the individual experts In other words, although there were differences among the scores assigned by the panel members for each of these tasks, each expert was individually consistent by assigning the same score for all three tasks. For each of these three tasks, technical panel member numbers 1, 2, and 5 assigned a score of absolutely essential to the task, technical panel member number 3 assigned a score of desired, and technical panel member number 4 assigned a score of undesired.  These scores resulted in a high level of conflict within the panel of technical experts However, when considering the overall scores of the panel of technical experts with the panel of legal experts, with four members indicating that the tasks were absolutely essential and one member indicating that the tasks were desired, the two panels were largely in agreement While the conditions found in tasks 53, 54, and 55 might indicate an outlier with technical panel member number 4, this view looses some merit when these three tasks are considered along with the scores of similar task 56. Task 56, disconnect all USB devices from the system unit, does not achieve a high level of agreement between the expert panels, and there is a high level of conflict within each panel Interestingly, both panels had the same number of members issuing the same scores for task 56.  Both panels had three members issue a score of absolutely essential, one member indicated desired, and one member assigned the score of undesired to the task Again, there appears to be disagreement among the experts concerning the treatment of secondary storage devices other than hard disks.

clarification concerning the best practices within this topic seems necessary, as mishandling of secondary storage media is likely to result in lost or inadmissible data In addition to the two topics discussed above, it is also interesting to note that of the ten tasks identified as having the highest level of conflict between the panels, scores indicating high conflict within one panel occurred in six of them. Additionally, three tasks were identified as having high conflict within the panel of technical experts and within the panel of legal experts. Of those three tasks, tasks 22 and 56 were discussed above; however, task 64, regarding filtering data based on attorney-client privilege prior to imaging, does not fit into the two topics discussed above. For task 64, one member of the technical panel indicated that it is absolutely essential, one member of the legal panel indicated that the task is desired, three members of the technical panel and two members of the legal panel indicated that it is undesired, and one member of the technical panel and two members of the legal panel indicated that is absolutely prohibited. This high value of conflict within both panels illustrates confusion in an area concerning e-discovery matters, and this is an area that is thought will experience high growth rates within the next several years. Computer forensics examiners will be well-served by additional clarification concerning best practices in e-discovery matters too  4. Conclusions  Our analysis of the data resulted in several interesting findings involving agreement and conflict among experts of computer forensics. Although the observations are interesting, our findings are bound by several limitations, and we see the need for more work to be done on this topic. We will summarize our observations, discuss limitations of our study, and present a call for additional research below  4.1. Summary of observations  It is interesting to note the differences in the levels of agreement observed from the various experts that participated in this study. While it is relatively easy to understand that some of the differences are due to the different perspectives from which the legal experts and the technical experts were asked to evaluate the tasks, there were many differences among each group, as well as differences between the groups. Also, from the complete set of 103 tasks evaluated, only 26 tasks achieved a level of high agreement among all of the experts, representing only 25% of the tasks Tasks where general agreement occurred within each group of experts, yet conflicting ratings occurred between the groups were observed however, this condition accounted for just under 10 of the total tasks evaluated. For example, only 10 tasks from the set of 103 tasks represent conditions where agreement occurred among the members of each panel, and the two panels reached conflicting results.  Although the differences in ratings between panels can be explained through the specific conditions from which each panel evaluates tasks differences between members within a panel of experts is more difficult to rationalize, and it occurred more frequently than did the instances where agreement occurred within panels yet conflict occurred between panels. In 16.5% of the tasks evaluated, members of the panel of legal experts reached conflicting ratings whereby at least one member felt very strongly that the task should be performed while at least one other member of the panel strongly felt that the task should not be performed. Even more conflicting was the level of disagreement among the members of the panel of technical experts, as they reached conflicting ratings in 17.5% of the tasks The level of conflict identified in this study cannot be attributed to one panel member providing outlying responses, as only one task among the subset of tasks that highly aligned \(i.e., those shown in Table 3. Top rated tasks\ was included in the subset of tasks with largest conflicts \(i.e., Table 4. Largest technical and legal conflicts\This task, task 10 concerned testing forensic software tools Overall, the large extent of conflict among forensic computer experts raises concern regarding reaching predictable outcomes when used in legal matters.  Forensic science is based upon using a measureable, scientific process to reach an unbiased conclusion, yet as this study illustrates, different forensic computer experts frequently do not reach the same conclusion concerning the importance to forensic task performance  4.2. Limitations  Although we attempted to be thorough in our analysis, it is important to note that numerous limitations exist, especially concerning the data collected. This study limited its survey population to the HTCIA; therefore, bias from the study population may impact th  How e v e r, it is  thought that opinions of experts within an organization, such as the HTCIA, are more likely to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


align than would opinions from a more diverse group of experts, thus measures of conflict are thought to be conservative in this report Also, concerning respondent bias, this study generated its output from a limited number of responses.  Non-respondents expressed reasons for not participating that included distrust, being too busy, vacation, and difficulty authenticating themselves on the survey s Website.  Invalid e-mail addresses and spam blocking filters also contributed to the reduction of responses [8  The set of 103 tasks presented within this report are not implied to represent a comprehensive set of tasks forensic examiners perform pertaining to the forensic data acquisition of personal computer workstations.  This set of tasks is limited to those that were identified by respondents of this study.  No conditional logic regarding the performance of tasks is suggested nor is the sequence of the performance of tasks  4.3. Call for additional research  Given the importance of expert testimony in legal proceedings and the level of conflict among forensic computer experts revealed within this study, more study is needed to develop a better understanding of the causes of conflict and solutions to reduce conflict For example, future studies may identify beneficial solutions from licensing organizations, industry standards, mandatory training, or legislation regarding the credentials of forensic computer examiners. Clearly, the inconsistency among forensic computer examiners opinions identified within this study illustrates a weakness within our legal system that has the potential to alter trail outcomes, thus allowing the guilty to be acquitted and the not-guilty to be wrongly convicted  5.

Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
