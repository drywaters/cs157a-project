we go People can check their e-mails exchange faxes surf the Internet edit documents and do shopping on the go The connection provided to users of these devices is significant for the quality and amount of data transmitted to preinstalled applications Scholars are attempting to co-exist the varieties of technologies commonly applied by focusing their research on introduction of proper multi-standard multi-protocol and multi-air interface devices Up to now 2G standards such as Interim Standard 54 IS54 and IS-136 IS-95 Global System Mobile Communication GSM and Personal Digital Cellular PDC are widely used in the mobile 
communication area At the same time 3G standards such as International Mobile Telecommunication-2000 IMT-2000 Code Division Multiple Access CDMA 2000 and Universal Mobile telecommunication System UMTS 1 are widespread Recently mobile communication systems have increased their data rates up to 2 Mbps thus allowing realtime transmission of real-video format Moreover wireless standards for local area networking such as IEEE 802.1 Ix 2 Bluetooth and emerging specifications of IEEE 802.16 are becoming more and more popular 3 Present technologies oblige their users to buy a particular device for each type of communication 
standard and operators have to deploy base stations for each system However these circumstances require to seamlessly switch user's equipment from one cellular standard to another or from the cellular network to hotspot For this case emerging multi-standards multi-bands multi-modes 4 and multi-protocols systems have been developed The capability to integrate as many as possible diverse services in a single terminal is extended Therefore Software Radio technology 14 SDR can serve as the fundamental technology SDR allows system reconfiguration and reprogramming by using only software commands These commands 
help to build the required architecture of the transceiver Thus SDR is the mechanism supporting system rebuild on request The work of SDR includes hardware adaptability by software means that is by downloading the necessary software from the network and installation By this way no skills and no efforts are required from the user The usage of new standards such as WiMAX IEEE 802.16e-2005 5 for providing a fast Internet connection with ability to transmit large data files and UMTS in telephony family are spreading widely 6 Thereby 1 


examination of the possibility to realize at least two standards over one common element base that will be then handled and rebuilt by SDR 7 has become relevant Thus SDR is one possible way to realize the structure of the device with high mobility flexibility and reconfigurability 8 This technology can provide seamless switching between existing air-interface standards The basic definition of SDR can be sketched as follows SDR is a system which can realize connection between different hardware units arranged in a radio node and govern the whole process by using software functions This kind of control widens perspectives of SDR systems development as it is the main part of mobile devices Moreover the chance to handle the system consisting of different radiofunctional units by applying software commands can be relevant for the reconfiguration and reprogramming 9 In this paper we present a new framework model for multistandard device The system switching must be carried out by SDR The multi-standard feature is composed of two new standards Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX In addition we introduce a novel approach to handle the signal processing for those standards The structural level of our development includes the baseband BB level of the transceiver architecture We present the SDR module framework that will be able to arrange the digital processing module The object-oriented programming environment we propose for the realization of our work The general structure will be constructed by a number of modules for each particular component of UMTS and WiMAX signal processing chain and also by the modules for common units This work aims at demonstrating how the proposed multi-standard terminal will work We show that the system can recognize the type of the signal and select a particular mechanism for its processing according to the modulation type code scheme and frequency range The uplink UL baseband architectures of WCDMA Wide-band Code Division Multiplexing and OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing have different radio configurations but they can share some similar parts Thus we present the description of these parts together with a possible solution to realize them as common blocks using SDR The rest of the paper is structured as follows Section 2 describes the base components which we use to build our system Section 3 sketches the description of a system workflow and considers common and special blocks Then Section 4 presents the choice of a hardware platform to check this system In Section 5 we present preliminary results obtained up to now by software simulations Finally the conclusions and directions of the future work are drawn in Section 6 2 BASE COMPONENTS The present situation in telecommunication area pushes vendors to find a solution to make coexisting different signal transmission technologies together in a single mobile device These technologies can come from a cellular side for example GSM or UMTS and from a WLAN side that can transmit the huge data traffic over wireless connection e.g Bluetooth for Personal Area Network or Wi-Fi Current mobile devices handle switching between different data transmission typologies by manual user interface Hence the user should spend their time to manage the process of transmission of any information The biggest problem of this approach is that it strongly depends on signal power In other words the user cannot transmit over Wi-Fi connection if its signal is weaker then cellular one Therefore the mobile device automatically switches to cellular and uses packet data transmission like General Packet Radio Service instead of a free local area connection Thus there is an actual need to provide switching between standards by a smart mechanism that would be able not only to estimate power of the signal but at the same time to verify the correctness of the data transmission for an application used SDR can be solution to this problem given that this technology allows to download install and setup different applications for the proper user's work Based on these features of SDR we selected this technology for realizing the seamless switching mechanism between UMTS and WiMAX All this technologies are basic components of the proposed system In the remainder of this section we describe in detail both standards and SDR technology 2.1 WCDMA Cellular mobile devices of the third-generation 3G have employed WCDMA as physical layer The band of the channel is 5 MHz and therefore wide enough to provide correct signal reception in multipath-fading propagation for both voice and data transmission with the constant data speed equal to 3.84 Mchip/sec In the best channel conditions this technology allows to obtain speed up to 2 Mbps for voice video data and image transmission The general parameters for WCDMA are presented in Table 1 1 WCDMA is based on the direct sequence code division multiple access modulation DS-CDMA that enables finding multi-user scenarios The main peculiarity of this technique is that signal energy is spread over a spectrum therefore the signal level can be compared to a noise level Each side in signal transmission process knows the spreading code or pseudo-noise sequence independent from message The advantages of spread spectrum technique for UMTS are followings  resistance to the radio interference and distortions  partial presence of the signal interception 2

This WirelessMAN-OFDM specification supports non-lineof-sight capability that is an important feature in urban area This quality is achieved by using frequency band less than 11 GHz This type of signal processing structure for the baseband level is determined using the multi-carrier transmission technique and is perfectly suitable for uplink and downlink transmissions The main parameters for IEEE 802.16-2004 are presented in Table 2 Table 2 Main parameters of WiMAX Parameters WiMAX 802.16-2004 Type of OFDM256 modulation Channel bandwidth Variable bandwidths from 1 to 28 MHz with 256 FFT Spectral efficiency 3.1-3.8 Mbit/s/Hz Guard interval Variable length guard interval at the beginning of the packet to compensate for multipath interference range from 32 to 1/4 symbol time Duplexing Time Division Duplexing TDD Frequency Division Duplexing FDD HalfDuplex FDD Cover Supported mesh network topology Different antenna systems are supported Diversity MIMO SDMA First of all we introduce OFDM as a multi-carrier modulation technique 23 that employs densely spaced orthogonal subcarriers and overlap its spectrums Figure 2 Figure 2 OFDM subcarrier spectrum Because subcarriers are orthogonal the bandwidth is used very efficiently Due to this features the inter-carrier interference is avoided at least over slowly time-varying fading channels 23 The WiMAX signal processing chain with OFDM PHY is depicted in Figure 3 OFDM technique becomes very important in urban area where mobile device meets a non-line-of-sight signal stuffed with reflections diffractions and scatterings In this case the downlink signal includes diffracted propagation paths a scattering energy multiply reflected parts and the direct path a vt 242Figure 3 The block scheme of WiMAX PHY layer architecture in UL direction The main principle of the OFDM technique is to divide the signal into N parallel data streams where each one has data rate equal to 1/N of the original rate After each data stream has been mapped to a tone at a unique frequency all of them are joined together in a single OFDM symbol by applying the inverse fast furrier transformation IFFT The OFDM symbol transmission is carried out by all parallel subchannels simultaneously The high rate is reached by simultaneous transmission However the rate of each subchannel may not be high On the one hand the subchannel mechanism is required the narrow bandwidth for minimization of the signal distortions on the other hand wide bandwidth guarantees the required high data rate 2.3 Software Defined Radio Present mobile telecommunication services promises to support different applications In the majority of the cases a different application is related to a particular standard 12 For the purpose of providing new services the novel user equipment UE appeared thus pushing users to buy it Nevertheless the UE with a little enhancement is existed very often and sometimes a costumer cannot purchase this piece of equipment because he or she knows that after a while a new one will appear It complicates the situation in telecommunication area and requires vendors to find new solutions to coexist as many as possible different communication standards in a single mobile node 13 However even if different standards existed in the same device the management between them should be realized by manual switching It makes users life difficult and normally costumers do not want to perform any manual tuning before sending data through their mobile devices Therefore switching between different standards must guarantee users that their data will be sent through dedicated network configuration This point makes vendors face the fact that switching between different standards in a mobile node should be done by software commands and the mobile device must be smart enough to choose the correct transmission environment Moreover the node must support the opportunity to be reprogramming under corresponded services and network requirements These problems can be 4

The special chains of processed blocks are built by the SDR modules which are included in the WiMAX/UMTS SDR library Then the SDR library is uploaded into DSP or FPGA The working principle of SDR modules and the SDR library are schematically illustrated in Figure 6 The top layer of Figure 6 contains the part in which user interacts with the system through the pre-developed terminal i.e User Interface In the same layer the interface communicates the user's queries to the next phase of the same layer i.e Control Module In the control module a simple monitoring phase is carried out In this phase the architecture ensures that the queries are correctly routed to the right download module After a message has been passed to the second step the Download Module serves as a memory buffer where information related to downloading is stored In addition depending on the message received from the previous step the Download Module communicates with the Network to retrieve necessary information The first layer is connected to the following one through the link established between the Download module and the Analyser stage of the architecture During this step the system analyzes the retrieved information in order to match it with the corresponding correct condition and as a result the way signals are processed is specified In parallel to this horizontal function the analyzer operates also in the vertical direction in order to ensure that no negative impact is made on the hardware layer IJ Figure 6 The block scheme of system framework for SDR module and SDR library The block developed in this model is the SDR control module with WiMAX/UMTS SDR library It consists of three basic components Set of software procedures Sequences library for WiMAX/UMTS and Configurator of chain The request of a correct function structure comes from Control module through Analyser system verifies the need parameters sent from the network Set of Software procedure stores functions description for all possible scenarios and connects to the Sequence library that provides the description of signal processing After that Configurator of chain collects some necessary functions required by specific signal transmission and reception procedures and connects to hardware level where these functions are implemented in digital form The bottom layer of the proposed workflow includes the hardware elements which obtain the particular chain of signal processing The Analyser plays a significant role as a mechanism of the work verification In other words this module compares the work done by hardware with requirements involved during established connections 4 IMPLEMENTING THE SDR MODULES 4.1 Common Blocks In this section we describe the structure of the physical layers of both UMTS and WiMAX that are based on WCDMA and OFDM techniques respectively We factor out the main blocks that can be implemented as SDR blocks Figure 2 shows the WCDMA architecture It contains such blocks as CRC attachment Transport Block TB concatenation and Code Block CB segmentation Channel Coding Radio frame Rf equalization 1st interleaving Rf segmentation Rate Matching Multiplexing Physical channel segmentation 2nd interleaving Data Mapping and Spreading Channelization and Scrambling In OFDM baseband level architecture shown in Figure 3 there are the following blocks Channel Coding Interleaver Constellation Mapper Data Mapping process Serial-toParallel S/P Converter IFFT with 256 points Parallel-toSerial P/S Converter and Cyclic Prefix Adder The common blocks and special blocks are presented in each baseband architecture We can organize them in the following order Channel Coding Interleaver and Data Mapping 4.1 1 Channel coding In this subsection we first explain UMTS encoder structure and then WiMAX encoder Each of them has it own parameters In the proposed model we combine encoder structures in one SDR block using a digital procedure description Since in OFDM the turbo coding scheme is existed as an optional performance we can define the turbo coding block as a common block in our UMTS/WiMAX architecture Channel coding block plays a very important role in baseband level signal processing The choice of scheme allows to guarantee grate error capability In 3GPP 6 


specification TS 25.212 V7.4.0 2007-03 two different ways of data encoding are presented convolutional encoding and turbo encoding schemes Turbo coding scheme was evaluated as a more robust method for channel encoding which allows to perform right decision in sense of correction error after signal transmission 16 By applying this scheme the system can achieve a higher throughput There are two possible methods of Channel Coding in UMTS physical layer architecture convolutional coding CC turbo coding TC The choice of coding scheme and coding rate depends on the specific data and/or control channel Such a choice is specified in UMTS standard 17 and shown in Table 3 Table 3 The correspondence TrCH types to coding scheme and coding rate Coding scheme Convolution coding Turbo coding Coding rate 1/2 1/2 1/3 1/3 code internal interleaver which forms input bits to a rectangular matrix RM with padding intra-row and interrow permutation of RM and output bits sequence from the RM with pruning The code block size used in bits input varies between 40 and 5114 Three types of RM exist for different block sizes 5 10 and 20 rows The number of columns depends on the input bit sequence and prime number of inter-row permutation After all permutations the bit sequence are written into the 2nd constituent encoder by taking columns by columns out There is a code block in the output of the Turbo encoder consisting of three tails bits from I't constituent encoder second constituent encoder and input bits to the Turbo encoder One of the Turbo coder parameters is the transfer function which characterizes relation between input and output For the 8-states constituent code of PCCC the transfer function is defined as follows 1 G\(D as Linear Feedback Xk Input bits Xk st Zk constituent encoder Intemnal Output interleaver d bits constituent encoder x Fieure 7 Block scheme of UMTS Turbo encoder Shift-Register and behaves cases Moreover this specification is included in the WCDMA coding scheme The constituent encoder is as pseudo-random scrambler The prime value of shift registers shall be equal to as a perspective direction for emerging standard IEEE 802.16-2004 In as follows 7 TrCh type BCH PCH RACH DCH FACH more robust and advanced scheme  1L gl\(D j where g1\(D and go\(D are polynomial functions for feedback branch and parity bit respectively These polynomials are defined as go\(D 1+D2 D3 gl\(D 1+D+D3 2 3 In use Reed-Solomon outer code and rate-compatible convolutional inner code Another way is to use Block Turbo Coding Finally the last possible approach is to adopt Convolutional Turbo Coding CTC scheme Since Turbo Coding scheme is zero when input bits an internal interleaver The encoder block scheme is shown in Figure 7 This scheme is based uses a double binary Circular RSC code The block scheme of encoder is shown in Figure 8 k/2 binary Figure 8 Convolutional Turbo Code encoder block scheme for WiMAX baseband processing The polynomials distinguishing the connections inside the Constituent encoder a binary Recursive Systematic Convolutional RSC code which is the key component of Turbo Coding The RSC principle works are defined in symbol notation one internal interleaver Each encoder is are being encoded The tail bits are padded in terms of trellis termination of turbo code processing The next important block of the Turbo encoder is the Turbo The next part described is the Coding Scheme in WiMAX baseband level 18 There are three different possibilities to realize the coding a coding rate equal to 1/3 The Turbo encoder component in the UMTS framework consists of two constituent encoders and one of the central parts of the CTC encoder that can be chosen with on a Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code PCCC with two 8-statets constituent encoders and process in Forward Error Correction subblock One possible solution is to we work with dedicated channels DCH of both transport and physical layer which provides data transmission Consequently the turbo coding scheme our framework model we consider it our model we took the Convolutional Turbo Coding in order to apply it like SDR block for both 


Yparity bit 1  D2  D\261 4 Feedback branch 1 D D 5 However in more precise description there are some discrepancies in each of Turbo Coding implementations The comparison between two schemes is realized in Table 4 As it is shown in the table below the main difference between coding schemes is that double bit sequence is present at input of encoder in OFDM process chain In addition inside the RSC the second bit should allow for future bit sequence transformation Table 4 Turbo Code Comparison for WCDMA and OFDM implementations Characteristics Type Termination Polynomials Rates WCDMA OFDM Binary 8-state Duo-Binary 8-state Tail bits 13 15 17 1/41 12  3 Circular 13 15 up to 8 4.1.2 Interleaver The interleaving process allows to avoid the burst error during signal transmission In both cases two permutations are performed From the UMTS point of view there is first interleaving made on a TrCH bit sequence The intercolumns permutation is done by the matrix with determined number of columns The number of columns depends on the size of TTI see Table 5 The main parameter of permutation scheme choice is TTI which is defined as a set of serially concatenated transport blocks and indicates how often data from the higher layer comes to the physical layer According to particular permutation pattern the output of I't interleaving is read as bit sequence Table 5 Link between TTI and number of columns TTI ms 10 20 40 80 Number of columns 1 2 4 8 Permutation patterns 0 0,1 0 2 1,3 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7 Next important process is intra-frame interleaving The second interleaving is performed in the physical channel This intra-frame permutation limits the number of columns to 30 and uses the universal common pattern to minimize the processing load and thus to reduce hardware scale and power consumption Also here a matrix has a rectangular structure and it is constituted by padding the dummy bits which are then pruned away in the output of the matrix after the inter-column permutation In OFDM we work with frequency interleaving mechanism which is aimed to spread the burst errors out in the bit-stream after FEC This process is accomplished in two step permutation first sub-carrier permutation and second bit-to-symbol mapping permutation Thus the mapping is performed by constellation of adjacent code bits into nonadjacent subcarriers Then these code bits are mapped onto significant components The block size equals to 384 coded bits per one interleaved block This number was defined by the functional dependence interleaver block size and modulation type given that in our framework model we use the QPSK modulation and the default number of subchannels i.e 16 The number of code bits NCPC equals to 2 in each sub-carrier Thus 1 12 6 where mk is coded bit index after first and before second permutation Nh'p is number of coded bits per allocated subchannels per OFDM symbol for our model assume 384 k is code bit index in input and equals to 0 1  Ncbps1 Second permutation allows constructing the bit-to-symbol mapping by equation jk mk  mk  N floor\(12.mk  N,bp  l 7 The issue is creation of common interleaving block The way of transformation will depend on kind of characteristic bit sequences These bit sequences should have the size corresponding to OFDM or WCDMA model 4.1.3 Data mapping In this subsection we describe the data mapping of the bit sequence onto I and Q branches using QPSK constellation In our UMTS/WiMAX system we consider QPSK as mapping scheme allocated before spreading transformation of WCDMA signal and before FFT mechanism for the OFDM signal It is necessary to say that QPSK mapping is a transfer of bit sequence consisting of binary 0 and binary 1 into the inphase 1 and the quadrature 1 of the realvalued part respectively Below we define the similarities and differences between the QPSK mapping of WCDMA signal and OFDM bit sequence in respect to SDR realization Since our model is developed for both dedicated transport and physical channels in followings explanations we speaks only about these types of channels in UMTS chain Data Mapping is accomplished after mapping Code Composite Transport Channel CCTrCH 19 constituted by multiplexing of few Transport Channels TrCH onto Dedicated Physical Channel as depicted on Figure 9 One PhCH can include just one CCTrCH in other words one CCTrCH can be spread between different PhCHs but there is no different CCTrCHs in one PhCH 8 we have fixed permutation pattern defined by equation mk  Ncbp 12 k.odl2 floor\(k 


Figure 9 TrCHs multiplexing and mapping onto PhCHs In WCDMA UL two types of dedicated physical channels data and control are multiplexed with I-Q/code technique which allows the parallel transmission separated different Dedicated Physical Data Channels DPDCHs and Dedicated Physical Control Channel DPCCH as shown in Figure 10 First step is the I-Q mapping in this constellation and then applying the combination either channelization code and scrambling or just scrambling code in case if there is no other PhCHs DPDCH1 DPDCH2 DPDCH3 Dedicated Physical DPCCH J Channel Control information provided by physical layer Figure 10 Physical layer transmission with parallel dedicated channels Each DPDCH shall be mapped onto I and Q components and DPCCH can be mapped only onto Q component This technique allows the separation of different signals by using the orthogonal phases 0 and n/2 The UMTS provides the transmission of up to six DPDCHs and one DPCCH simultaneously From WiMAX point of view OFDM signal has a constellation mapper in the signal processing scheme Different data rates are supported in WiMAX signal processing It influences onto the mapping technique This process provides the map of bits into the OFDM symbol description by applying gray-mapped QPSK technique Here code bits are mapped into I and Q symbol coordinates In OFDM case we perform signal transformation with set of subcarriers separated as data carriers pilot carriers and null carriers Data carriers carry information bits Pilots ensure the synchronization between Transmitter and Receiver parts and channel estimation as well And nulls are used to avoid Inter-Symbol Interference i.e Guard Interval in time domain and like the direct current DC carrier There is no any information in nulls carriers Thus all allocated data subcarriers shall be modulated by Graymapped QPSK In the output of constellation mapper we have I and Q symbols which are organized into OFDM symbol after IFFT block The general mapping scheme becomes the same for both cases This module can be implemented as the common unit for both configurations independently so that in WCDMA we obtain up to 6 channels and 200 subchannels in OFDM The software system framework was defined in objectoriented descriptions For our two standards we have to consider different scenarios For first try we implement parameters defined in previous section 4.2 Special blocks The rest of each signal processing chains is described in proper way As we can see from Figure 1 and Figure 2 the chain of UMTS is more complicated for WiMAX and includes different modules Basically we considered following modules in UMTS chain the transport block concatenation because we need to make single transport block after adding CRC radio frame equalization block must appear to confirm the proper frame size for next processing steps especially for the rate matching block where the suitable frame size needs to be determined radio frame segmentation plays important role when we work with TTI more than 10 ms In multiplex module we arrange the frame by frame in 10 ms interval for each TrCH The next module is the spreading block that is discussed below more specifically In the WiMAX chain the randomizer can be selected as the special block serial-to-parallel parallel-to-serial converters cyclic prefix insertion and IFFT All these signal processing elements can be concatenated in one block called OFDM symbol creation IFFT256 is considered in more detail below Each special block has its own description as a class of the library By object-oriented method we can create set of classes that defined each function separately and can be applied in future hardware implementation The corresponding pseudo code for the radio frame segmentation module is presented in Figure 11 The first block of the UMTS scheme is the Cyclic Redundancy Check CRC attachment The data comes from upper layer is separated in transport blocks Each block should have the error detection part which can be realized by adding the CRC The size CRC can vary between 24 16 12 8 and 0 bits For our system we use CRC with 16 bits size These parity bits must be generated by the following polynomial generator CRC D  D16 D 12 D 1 8 After the CRC step the transport blocks are transmitted during definite TTI must be concatenated and if the size of result is greater than 5114 bits then the code block segmentation procedure will be executed In the initial 9 


an attribute specified for each transport channel TrCH and depending one limitation This limitation is that only one symbol In the special blocks description we also focused our attention parameters case where ensure the suitable end frame size which corresponds to the specified bit rate and the spreading factor After this Rate Matching RM is applied This process plays the key role in further procedures The matching ensure the right way for physical channels mapping and data processing After multiplexing all TrCHs into can be mapped onto we choose the size of transport block equal to 1280 bits Hence this step we can be eliminated from the system Next step in signal processing is presented by Frame segmentation element Figure 11 Example of pseudo code for radio frame segmentation module Frame segmentation should be done to we can avoid the presence of this procedure PhCH mapping process includes few items Data mapping Channelization and Scrambling As shown in the Figure 1 on SDR blocks work The step-by-step data exchange between one or more Coded Composite Transport Channels CCTrCH one or several PhCHs If one PhCH is used common and special blocks is presented in Figure 12 vi r fIJMT 4ooo o Figure 12 Data processing block scheme 10 READ module rfsegmentation DETERMINE number of frames SET input signal to particular input port IF number of frame more than 1 THEN EXTRACT first data bits of input bits sequence SET framel equals to input data bits PRINT length of framel EXTRACT next data bits of input bits sequence SET frame2 equals to next part PRINT length of frame2 EXTRACT last data bits of input data bits SET frameN equals to last data bits PRINT length of frameN SET output sequence equals to framel frame2 frameN ENDIF SET output port equals to output on two different modules for both chains spreading module for UMTS and IFFT256 for WiMAX Spread spectrum mechanism is the most important thing in whole signal processing chain of WCDMA PHY It is based on the Direct Sequence which provides the expending of one PhCH hence are calculated As ensures equality of the total bit rate after transport channel TrCH multiplexing to the total channel bit rate of the allocated dedicated physical channels PhCH The main parameter of the rate matching is on the upper layers During this step the determination of the spreading factor and the number of physical channels needed for the given number of TrCH we can map CCTrCH into Physical Channel but there is one CCTrCH we have we have to apply PhCH segmentation block In our system implementation we consider a QPSK mapping is used for Data Mapping in Physical channel mapping processing This scheme maps every two bits into signal END 1 E a result of fulfilling this step the correct form of TrCH multiplexing is selected that a bandwidth by unique channelization code This code should be generated by code-tree of orthogonal variable spreading factor OVSF codes Thus it guarantees the orthogonality between different channels during signal transmission 1 In OFDM chain the main role is played by IFFT256 that converts time domain presentation into frequency domain and provides orthogonal independency between adjacent subcarriers 4.3 Main Procedures between SDR blocks There are a set of inherent procedures in the system work which must be done during the signal transmission between SDR blocks 1 Verification the signal nature 2 Switching to particular signal path 3 Reconfiguration of the system according to required protocol scheme 4 Stepby-step signal processing 5 Signal transmission in the chosen mode These procedures present only basic process The BB processing which this paper is presented based more than

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
