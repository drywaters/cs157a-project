Towards a mission planning toolbox for the Airborne Network Optimizing ground coverage under connectivity constraints Abhishek Tiwari Anurag Ganguli Ashwin Sampath UtopiaCompression Corporation 1150 West Olympic Boulevard Suite 1020 Los Angeles CA 90064 Abstract The Airborne Network AN is a constellation of networked aircrafts flying in periodic orbits AN is an enabling technology for Network Centric Warfare for the military autonomous air traffic control for commercial aviation and for providing internet access over a broad urban area AN is a highly dynamic environment and presents challenges that have not been addressed in traditional wire-line or wireless MANET research Wireless 
links in AN are quasi-persistent and break due to platform banking and antenna shadowing In this paper the objective is to deploy airborne nodes so that they provide ground nodes with high data upload capacity while making sure that a minimal topology within the backbone airborne network is always maintained For the sake of simplicity of presentation we make a few assumptions on the trajectories of the airborne nodes We verify our assumptions against a well studied airborne network deployment scenario Using tools from convex optimization we determine optimal locations of airborne nodes for three different scenarios We present 
our results graphically and illustrate them using examples TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 2 3 4 INTRODUCTION  PRELIMINARIES  MISSION PLANNING  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  REFERENCES  3 8 9 1 INTRODUCTION The United States Air Force envisions deployment of the Airborne Network AN by the year 2020 This will enable the Department of Defense DoD Global Information Grid GIG information exchanges via airborne platforms There is also a great deal of interest within the DoD to achieve interoperability between various DoD networks The AN

urban internet service providers Internetworked planes can enable sophisticated distributed conflict resolution for autonomous air traffic control applications For the airborne network to be used for the above application mission planning tools that take into consideration ground coverage and connectivity need to be developed To the best of our knowledge few researchers have addressed the problem of AN planning and deployment We discuss the relevant articles in the following paragraph In 1 the authors talk about communication planning for future deployment of the airborne network but there is no mention of how to plan the network if connectivity to 
ground nodes is also an issue In 2 a few alternative architectures for link management are presented In 3 the authors identify network parameters throughput latency etc availability of network airborne node collision safety and network security as fundamental issues in the design of the AN for commercial aviation In 4 the authors present a few deployment scenarios where heterogenous airborne nodes are placed at different elevations They also evaluate the performance of commercial off the shelf routing protocols in the airborne network scenario In 5 the authors look at the problem of 
deploying UAVs to provide connectivity to ground nodes However the inter-aircraft connectivity maintenance is not considered As against AN planning and deployment there has been a lot of research lately on applying and comparing existing Mobile Ad hoc Networks MANET routing protocols for different Airborne Network scenarios 6 7 and 8 In 6 the authors compare the performance of four MANET protocols AODV TORA OLSR OSPFv3-MANET The comparison is done on modified OPNET source code that reflects aircraft banking and antenna occlusion The metrics used for comparison are protocol overhead packet 
delivery ratio and packet delay For the scenario discussed in 6 it has been found that the proactive protocols OLSR and OSPFv3-MANET provided the best performance results with high packet delivery ratio and consistent low end-to-end delays In 7 Border Gateway Protocol BGP which is the defacto standard in use today to provide terrestrial inter-networking routing has been tried in airborne network domain Airborne network nodes predominantly employ line of sight LOS radio links which can range up to 200 nautical miles However LOS is unavailable when the aircrafts are turning due to shadowing caused I 


by platform banking Link outages caused as a result of antenna shadowing can last up to 30 minutes 9 Deploying thousands of nodes in the airborne backbone is prohibitive due to the cost reasons which implies that the number of backbone nodes will of the order of tens Long periods of link unavailability in such sparse backbone may result in a disconnected topology if the deployment of the airborne network is not done carefully Researchers in the area of routing for airborne network have cited the sparseness of the airborne network as a major hurdle 6 7 In order to overcome the topology sparseness problem there is an absolute necessity for a systematic formulation of planning and optimization for airborne network deployment under topology constraints To the best of our knowledge even though researchers have attempted to lay out the metrics for the airborne network deployment problem a rigorous analysis of optimizing the metrics is still missing In this paper we lay out a mathematical foundation to optimize airborne network deployment for three specific scenarios In each of the three scenarios the objective is to maximize the coverage provided to nodes on the ground which serve as sources and sinks of information A minimal set of communication links within the AN is used as a constraint so as to ensure a minimal level of connectivity The work presented here forms part of airborne network mission planning toolbox under development at UtopiaCompression Corporation Our team is also developing routing solutions for the airborne network but that work is beyond the scope of this paper In Section 2 we introduce the notation that we use in the paper along with some preliminary concepts In Section 3 we first introduce metrics to evaluate the quality of air-ground and air-air communication links respectively We then analyze three different airborne network deployment scenarios and optimize ground coverage under topology constraints using tools from convex optimization Finally we sum up our conclusions and present future research directions in Section 4 2 PRELIMINARIES In this section we introduce some preliminary notation and concepts that will be used throughout the course of the paper We begin with the notation Let R denote the set of real numbers We look at ground nodes i.e locations on the surface of the earth which serve as sources and sinks of information Let 1 QM G denote the locations of M ground nodes where 9i C R 2 for all i We look at a group of aircraft which act as nodes to relay the information between the ground nodes This group of relay nodes form the airborne network We make the following assumptions that are specific to the airborne network Al There are no multi-path effects Two nodes airborneairborne or airborne-ground can communicate with each other if there exists a direct line of sight between them and the Euclidean distance between them is less or equal to the radio range rradio This assumption makes sense for the airborne network scenario due to its operation in free space A2 As a first step mission planning for airborne network deployment is assumed to be done off-line at the Tactical Operations Center TOC The flight plans for the entire mission are then available to the routing equipment on each airborne node Under normal practice the pilots of the airborne nodes are given air tasking orders ATO before the mission that they are bound to follow as closely as possible A3 All airborne nodes fly in circular trajectories of same radius r at the same elevation z and there is zero tilt in their orbits with respect to the horizontal earth surface The airborne nodes fly at a constant speed s in their respective orbits Figure 1 from 1 illustrates a typical airborne network deployment scenario One can notice that the trajectories of different airborne nodes are circular and elongated elliptical In this paper for ease of presentation of concepts we have made the above stated assumptions Optimizing over a larger class of trajectories is an avenue of future research  M M P B N&de 1S  _ Node Node 16 17  Figure 1 scenario Illustration of an airborne network deployment A4 We assume the curvature of earth to be zero over the region of deployment of the airborne network As in 1 this assumption has been made to simplify the analysis but the tools presented are applicable in the most general case A5 For the purpose of optimization in this paper we assume that the banking of the aircraft while turning does not occlude the transmitter or the receiver located on the aircraft Taking banking into account while optimizing is another avenue of future research We let fA1 AN  be the locations of the N points in R 3 signifying the centers of the circular trajectories of the airborne nodes Since the airborne nodes are assumed to move at constant altitude the coordinates of the Ai's representing the altitude are the same for all i Now given a trajectory center A  Xa Ya z and a ground node 9 xg x  yg 0 let dA-g denote the distance between the projection of the center of the airborne node trajectory and the ground node 2 


Now the derivative of 0 with respect to dA g is given by dA  Xag Ya Yg 1 3 Similarly let dA,_ j denote the Euclidean distance between the trajectory centers of two airborne nodes i and j We assume that information can be transmitted over a communication link at B bits per second Assuming an airborne node flies at a fixed elevation z at any time instant it can communicate with any ground node located within a disc of radius Rgnd  zrradio-Z2 centered at the point on the ground vertically below the airborne node We refer to this disc as the ground footprint of an airborne node Please refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of the above notation 3 MISSION PLANNING In this section we discuss various scenarios involving the problem of optimal deployment of the airborne network to provide coverage to a set of given ground nodes In order to do this we first analyze how the average quality of a communication link varies with the distance between two nodes Communication link quality Air-ground communication link In this section we quantify the quality of an air-ground upload link using the maximum data upload capacity metric Let us consider a ground node Figure 2 Instantaneous coverage footprint of an airborne node flying in a circular trajectory at a constant elevation The effective capacity offered to node A is instantaneous wireless channel capacity averaged over one time period of the airborne node g and an airborne node moving along a circular trajectory centered at A as shown in Figure 2 It follows from the figure that the amount of time the ground node can communicate with the airborne node is 2r0/s where r is the radius of the loitering trajectory s is the speed of the airborne node and 0 is given by d2_  r2 Rg2 A~~gnd 0  arccos 2rdA-g 2 d A_9  Rgnd r2 Ar _ 5 2rdA-9 The above expression is non-positive for all values of dA g if Rgnd  r Under this condition the amount of time the air-ground link is active decreases with increasing values of dA g Also if the distance dA g is less than or equal to Rgnd r then there exists a air-ground link for all time On the contrary if dA g  Rgnd  r then the air-ground link never exists Let us now compute the average capacity of an air-ground communication link We assume that the ground node 9 in Figure 2 generates bits at a constant rate C bits per second and that it has a finite buffer The ground node can upload bits to the airborne node only when the air-ground link is active Therefore to prevent the finite ground node buffer from overflowing the number of bits generated by the ground nodes in one time period should be less than the number uploaded when the air-ground link is active This implies 2w7r 20Or C  B 4 s s Therefore the maximum data upload capacity of a ground node Cmax is given by B  From Equation 3 for Rgnd  r 0 is a decreasing function of dA g This in turn implies that Cmax is a decreasing function of dA g Thus the closer a trajectory center is to a ground node the higher is the maximum data upload capacity For the rest of this paper we assume that the condition Rgnd  r always holds Air-air communication link In this section we introduce a metric to quantify the quality of an air-air communication link which we term as the link activity percentage Let Ai Aj be the centers of the circular trajectories of two airborne nodes Let us assume that the two trajectories have the same radius r and the two aircraft have identical ground footprint Rgnd and speed s Let wij be the product of their angular velocities and let Oij be the relative phase The activity percentage of the link i j denoted by actij sgn\(wij Oij is defined as the fraction of the time period 2w7r/s during which the distance between the two aircraft is less than rradio Using the above definition we can also characterize the airair link quality that is dependent only on the distance between the centers of the loiter orbits of the aircrafts rsep and not on their angular velocities and relative phases This is the worstcase link activity percentage and is given by min actij sgn\(wij Oij 5 sgn\(wij Oijc[0,27 3 i.e 


Figure 3 Illustration of circular trajectories of two airborne nodes centered at Ai Aj The distance between two fixed points p and P2 increases with increase in dA Aj compare and dp,1P2 and dA A in the top and bottom figures The relation between the worst-case link activity percentage and rsep is characterized by the following lemma Lemma 3 1 min actij sgn\(ij  Oij  sgn wij c{f 1 1 Oijc O 2w Ground coverage optimization We now discuss various scenarios related to optimization of airborne trajectories for maximizing the ground coverage Scenario 1 Unspecified ground node locations Consider the situation where an airborne network comprising of N airborne nodes has to be deployed to provide coverage to ground nodes that are distributed uniformly over a region D C R2 Let T  V 8 be a connected topology where V is the set of airborne nodes and S represent communication links between airborne nodes For a given deployment scenario S is the minimal set of airborne links that must have a desired worst-case link activity percentage for the entire duration of the deployment of the airborne network Since there is no explicit information on the locations of the ground nodes in this scenario we wish to spread out the airborne nodes over the region D One approach to achieve this is to maximize the variance of the inter-aircraft distances The corresponding following optimization problem is as follows maximize{f1,A 2Z Al2  Al I E dAi Aj ij 6 subject to Ai rASep Vij C S Ai c D A=D 7 8 9 is a decreasing function of d4_ J Proof From Equation 5 the lemma is true if actij sgn\(ij  Oij is a decreasing function of dAi j for any given sgn\(wij and ij This follows directly from the observation that if we fix the location of two points P1 P2 on the two trajectories then the distance between them increases strictly as dA j increases see Figure 3 U The above lemma implies that by choosing a certain value of rsep one can guarantee a certain link quality irrespective of the choice of the relative phases It has been observed in earlier research 6 that the relative phases of the airborne nodes have a significant effect on air-air link quality and thus on routing protocol performance In what follows we will use constraints of the form dA Aj _ rsep to guarantee air-air link quality Notice that the worst-case link activity percentage is also representative of the maximum delay that an incoming packet may experience at any node Intuitively speaking the amount of time that a packet may have to wait before being transmitted depends on the time for which the link is inactive We believe that this measure can be useful in designing networks for delay-tolerant applications Also for a given network quantities such as the buffer size required at any node can be computed using the same measure where Ai's are the locations of the centers of trajectories of airborne nodes A is the centroid of the trajectory centers and D is the centroid of the region D Note eqn 7 constrains the centers of trajectories of airborne nodes so that the air-air communication link has a worst-case link activity percentage corresponding to rsep Remrark 3.2 If the airborne nodes fly in phase and rsep  rradio then eqn 7 guarantees persistent communication link between airborne nodes at all times Under the constraint that topology IT is connected the objective function in Equation 6 is always bounded Also note that the objective function and the constraints are convex but since this is a maximization problem the solution will lie on the boundary of constraint set There are no guaranteed methods to maximize a convex function under convex constraints A problem similar to 6 has been solved in 10 using semidefinite programming for maximum variance unfolding We adopt a similar approach as described in the following We change the optimization variables to the elements of Gram matrix 11 associated with the vectors A1,A2  AN The corresponding Gram matrix is given by AC A A where A A1lA2  AN 10 4 


so that Cij  A[TAj Therefore we can write dA Cii  jj-2/ij 11 Without loss of generality we can assume that the centroid of the domain D is at the origin Under this assumption constraint 9 becomes N 1 Ai  0 where 0 is the column vector of zeros In terms of the Gram matrix the constraint becomes Ei j Zij  0 as shown in 10 Also the objective function Eij dAiAj turns out to be the sum of eigenvalues of the Gram matrix IC which is defined to be the trace of the matrix denoted by Tr\(IC Problem 6 can now be posed as a semi-definite program SDP 11 as follows maximize Tr\(IC 12 subject to Cii  Cjj2/Cij rSep Vij C S  C  0 i,j 13 14 15 where the optimization variables are the elements of IC Constraint 15 implies that IC is a positive semi-definite matrix as it is an inner-product matrix We have used YALMIP 12 to solve the above semi-definite program Note that the transformation from points in Euclidean space to elements of Gram matrix preserves the inter-node distances and angles but dimensionality information is lost In other words the information that Ai eR 2is not preserved Now we describe a technique to convert the optimal Gram matrix solution to N vectors in R2 If the optimal solution lies in a higher dimension this technique will only give the projections of the optimal vectors on R2 Let Co,pt denote the optimal solution to 12 know that Copt is a real Hermitian matrix therefore by the spectral theorem for Hermitian matrices 13 we know that there exists a real orthogonal matrix F and a real diagonal matrix A such that opt  FAFT 16 The diagonal entries of A are the eigenvalues of kCopt Now since opt is positive semi-definite one can compute A Also let A be such that the eigenvalues are arranged in ascending order with A\(N N being the largest We now rewrite equation 16 as The operation of choosing the last two entries of every column of B is essentially taking the projection of the solution obtained by solving the SDP onto R 2 There is a certain class T of the topology graphs 7 for which the first N 2 entries of all the columns of B turn out to be zero This means that the N solution point gotten by solving the SDP in equation 12 lie on the same plane A simple cycle and a tree are trivial members of the class T but from the example below it is evident that the class T of topology graphs includes more kinds of graphs Example 1 Imagine we have to spread out 5 airborne nodes over R 2 Let the topology T be given by the following topology adjacency matrix 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 O 1 0 1 0 O 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0i 13 18 With rsep  200 nautical miles we first solve the SDP in equation 12 and then compute vectors in R 5 columns of B It turns out that for the given topology all these lie on the same plane The solution in shown in Figure 4\(a Note that the links in the given topology 18 are stretched to the value rSep Also if the input is a ring topology the optimal locations are again in R 2 with the locations as shown in Figure 4\(b Complete characterization of the class T is an avenue of future work 200 150 ___---2 3 200 200 50 200 S2pO 100 2 150 t 20 3 4 a topology in example I 150 100 50 0 50 100 150 X loction b ring topology Figure 4 Spreading out airborne nodes under different topology constraints Circles represent the optimal locations of the airborne trajectory centers The line segments between trajectory centers represent the links corresponding to the input topology 7 The numeric values alongside the line segments represent the distances between the corresponding aircraft centers opt  BBT 17 where the columns of B  FA are N vectors in RN whose Gram matrix is opt In order to get N vectors in R 2 we choose the last two entries of each column vector Scenario 2 Fair coverage of multiple ground nodes using one airborne node Let Q1 92   gM be the locations of the ground nodes Let us now solve the problem of placing a single airborne node A to provide fair coverage to all ground nodes In other words we would like to solve the following 5 3 150 100 100 200 50 Q00o c 50 P 0I 200 2 50 200 100 I/A 150

of the nodes is not assigned to any ground node as described earlier The topology for airborne network is again a ring Notice that the communication links between airborne and ground nodes are shorter now signifying greater upload capacity This is due to the fact that the extra airborne node allows for the network to spread out more and hence get closer to the ground nodes 4 Ground nodes 4 Airborne nodes Ix 32 3464 250 P 200 f68 3215 150 49~2218 100 501541 98 99 74 52 0632 1 Choose uniformly and randomly N cluster centers 2 Assign each ground node to the cluster center that is nearest to it Let Qcl  c be the ground nodes assigned to the cth cluster 3 For each cluster say c compute the new cluster center as k  Argmin max dA-gm i A i{fci  I 44 4 Repeat the above steps till the locations of the cluster centers do not change beyond a certain threshold Let A AN be the cluster centers kl  kN obtained as the output of the algorithm Next the convex optimization problem in Equations 33 and 34 is solved to obtain the desired airborne trajectory centers   760~53 52 0632 200 150 100 50 0 50 100 150 x Figure 5 Coverage using multiple airborne nodes when locations of ground nodes are known Here we have 4 ground nodes denoted by s and 4 airborne nodes denoted by circles The axes represent x,y lLocations on a 2 D plane The optimal placement results in each airborne node providing coverage to a unique ground node while maintaining a connected topology between themselves 1-76-77-72142265 150 100 50 0 x 39 5904 50 100 Figure 6 In thLs case there is an extra airborne node The op timal placement in this case results in higher maximum data upload capacity to each ground node Note that one airborne node approximately at 60,130 acts purely as a relay 2 Number of ground nodes greater than the number of airborne nodes In this case the problem in general is NP hard An efficient and popular method of solving this problem is a heuristic similar to the k-means clustering algorithm described as follows 4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Conclusions In this paper we have studied the placement planning problem of the airborne network We first define two metrics maximum data upload capacity for air-ground links and worst case link activity percentage for air-air links We have shown that the maximum data upload capacity is a measure of the coverage provided to a single ground node and the worst case link activity percentage for a single air-air link is a decreasing function of the distance between the centers of the loiter orbits of the airborne nodes We have also discussed how this measure is useful in the design of networks for delay-tolerant applications This paper considers three practically interesting scenarios for the deployment of the airborne network backbone where the purpose of the airborne network is to provide coverage to the ground nodes while maintaining a certain degree of reliability and connectivity in the inter-airborne node topol8 250 200 7.3458 46.9364 Figure 7 A snapshot of the optimal coverage of 4 ground nodes using 5 airborne nodes The rings at the top indicate the loiter orbits of the airborne nodes the shaded circles on the ground indicate their respective instantaneous coverage disk and the fixed ground node positions are indicated by s 150  100 _ 50 24.9954 200 4 Ground nodes 5 Airborne nodes 15.8688

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
