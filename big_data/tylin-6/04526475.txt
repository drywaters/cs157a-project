overcome these limitations we propose a system that employs small uninhabited aerial vehicles UAV and reconfigurable computing RC technologies to enable fire fighting personnel to quickly and effectively locate hotspots This paper explores the technologies proposed for the hotspot detection system including the algorithms for detecting and tracking of hotspots It investigates the characterisation of these hotspots for autonomous detection including data collection and testing techniques It also describes the system's requirements as well as 
its components and architecture 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 BACKGROUND 1 3 HOTSPOTS 6 4 HOTSPOT DETECTION SYSTEM 8 5 CONCLUSION  11 6 FUTURE WORK  11 REFERENCES  11 BIOGRAPHY  13 1 INTRODUCTION Wildfires or Bushfires are a very common occurrence throughout most of Australia during the summer months due to Australia's high summer temperatures and dry climate They are a very serious threat to life 
property and the economy with past bushfires devastating large areas of Australia taking numerous lives and destroying vast property and livelihoods Due to the hazardous and capricious nature of bushfires fire fighters ideally require real time information about bushfires to enable them to fight these fires safely and in a timely manner However in many circumstances this task has proven to be difficult due to factors such as lack of visibility limited resources outdated 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

paper#1155 Version 2 Updated 2007:12 16 local weather information between fire fighters and inadequate communications The South Australia Country Fire Service CFS has identified burning embers left in the wake of a fire or hotspots as they will be referred to in this paper as a significant problem This is because if not extinguished hotspots can reignite a bushfire even after it was thought contained This unfortunately occurred in the January 2005 Eyre Peninsular bushfire[l resulting in further destruction and tragic loss of life Hotspots 
are currently located by fire fighters through visual inspections of a bushfire's perimeter by looking for signs of smoke and hotspots One of the best known ways to gather this type of information is from the air However this can be ineffective due to the amount of time it can take to mobilize the aircraft and costly because of their operational and purchasing costs This aerial observation can also be perilous for pilots and aircraft due to high unpredictable winds hazardous terrain and smoke 
obscuring the terrain and the fire Even if these limitations can be overcome the ability to process this information into a format that can be easily interpreted and then reliably delivered to stakeholders in real-time presents a number of challenges This research aims to overcome these limitations and challenges through the use of small uninhabited aerial vehicles UAVs reconfigurable computing RC technologies and a payload of infrared and visual sensors The result of this research will be a hotspot detection system that will autonomously detect and locate 
hotspots from the air It will transmit hotspot locations and sensor imagery to fire-fighters on the ground This will enable them to efficiently and effectively deal with these hotspots before they have the opportunity to reignite and cause further losses or damage 2 BACKGROUND This section will demonstrate that there is a need for a hotspot detection system to enhance bushfire fire-fighting in Australia through a literature review of bushfires bushfire monitoring UAVs RC and computer vision It will show 1 


how this system will benefit from exploiting the advantages of UAVs and RC Bushfires Bushfires are very common occurrences throughout Australia during the warmer months of the year These bushfires pose a serious threat to life property and the economy with past bushfires devastating large areas of the country destroying innumerable properties livelihoods and lives in the process The threat they pose is clearly illustrated in Figure 1 which shows a bushfire endangering houses in the Australian State of New South Wales NSW on New Year's Day 2006 Figure 1 Fire fighters protecting houses from a bushfire in NSW\(2006  Other examples of the devastation bushfires can cause were the 1983 Victorian and South Australian Ash Wednesday bushfires which took lives of 47 people in Victoria and 28 people in South Australia They also burnt 418,000 hectares destroyed 2,383 houses killed over 27,000 head of livestock and caused over 400 million in property losses[3 The number of homes destroyed annually due to bushfires in Australia has remained constant over the last 70 years with an average of 83 homes lost yearly to bushfires throughout Australia over this period This equates to an average annual cost of about 33.5 million not including the cost of the lives or other property destroyed by these fires This is despite large increases in population improvements in fire fighting technology and in understanding of bushfire physics[4 These figures show that there is a definite need for research that will help reduce the loss and destruction that these fires can cause The next section looks at the current methods of monitoring bushfires with an aim of highlighting any gap that our research can exploit Bushfire Monitoring Methods The three current methods for gathering bushfire information are ground satellite and aerial based detection and monitoring systems[5 Ground Based Ground based bushfire monitoring involves the use of human observers and sensor technology including Closed Circuit Television CCTV and infrared cameras This method can be divided into fixed position and mobile detection and monitoring of fires The accuracy of it is therefore limited to that of the human observers Ground based fire monitoring systems also have the inherent difficulty in getting an un-obscured view of a fire due to smoke the terrain and/or vegetation[5 The use of CCTV and infrared cameras can increase the accuracy of ground based fire detection and monitoring[6 It can also reduce the number of personnel required to monitor fires but the problem still remains that it is difficult to obtain an unobstructed view of the fire or to view a large enough areas of the fire to make it useful for our research[7 Due to these limitations ground base fire monitoring methods were deemed not to be the best option for this research Satellite Based Satellite monitoring of fires involves the use of either geo-synchronous or sun-synchronous satellites[6 An example of a sun-synchronous satellite based system is the Australian Government's Sentinel[8 bushfire monitoring system This system is designed to detect locate and help assess risks to the public and property from bushfires rather than as a tool to help fight these fires[8 Satellites are best used for the detection of large fires as their resolution is too small for the detection of hotspots[9 This is plainly demonstrated by Figure 2 where objects such as the hotspots this research is interested in are too small to be detected in these types of images Figure 2 Satellite infrared imagery of bushfires raging in South Eastern Australia January 2003  Sun-synchronous satellite orbit periods are also not short enough for practical real-time fire monitoring[9 All satellites also have the problem of fire being occluded by clouds[5 A hotspot detection system using satellites is 2 


therefore not reliable sensitive or timely enough for the system proposed in this research Aerial Based Aerial monitoring of bushfires is done using aircraft which allows for continual monitoring of fires in almost any location It gives an unobstructed view of the fire and with the use of infrared imaging can detect and track a fire through smoke Aerial monitoring of bushfires is done using numerous different types of aircraft including fixed wing and rotary winged aircraft These types of aircraft can be further separated into piloted and uninhabited aircraft An example of a rotary winged aircraft used in fire fighting is the Agusta Bell 412 Helicopters shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 Agusta Bell 412 Fire Fighting Helicopter[1i Fixed wing aircraft generally fly higher faster for longer durations and have greater stability than rotary winged aircraft An example of fixed wing aircraft used in fire monitoring and mapping systems are the United States Department of Agriculture's USDA Forest Service's PHOENIX fire monitoring system[12 airplanes shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 USDA PHOENIX fire monitoring system aircraft a Cessna Citation Bravo jet b King Air 200 turbo prop[12 Piloted aircraft like those in Figure 3 and Figure 4 require millions of dollars annually for purchasing and ongoing expenditure This makes their use very costly for use in the proposed hotspot detection system These types of systems also have long turnaround times for processing of the data they collect Piloted aircraft are therefore better utilized in fire suppression missions and will not be employed as the data gathering platform for the hotspot detection system proposed in this research Current State of South Australian Bushfire Monitoring The South Australian Country Fire Service CFS currently uses human observers to detect fires and hotspots They receive notification of a fire outbreak either through a member of the public ringing the emergency services or from CFS personnel manning lookout towers Once a fire has been detected they use both aerial and ground observation to monitor the fire itself and detect possible hotspots They do not currently use an automated fire detection system They do collect digital information on bushfires from the air but only when the fires are of a longer duration This is because they currently require 24 hours to set up their digital fire data collection system The CFS currently loans a fixed wing fire monitoring aircraft from the neighbouring Australian state of Victoria to gather their fire data It currently takes 6 hours for fire data to be available once gathered This is because the aircraft is required to land and offload the data before any processing can begin The CFS therefore tends to use this information for planning for future fires rather than helping them fight the current fire or detect hotspots Due to this lengthy delay any data gathered this way will not be very useful for detecting hotspots for this research The current state of SA bushfire monitoring shows that there is a definite need for an inexpensive and easy to use hotspot detection system As stated previously one of the best ways to gather information about bushfires is from the air but this can be ineffective and even dangerous for pilots due to high unpredictable winds hazardous terrain and the problem of smoke obscuring both the fire and the terrain There has been increasing interest in the use of uninhabited airborne vehicles UAVs to help overcome these problems therefore they will be explored in the following section Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles UA V Almost all of the functions performed by the pilot of an aircraft can now be automated using a combination of computing and data communications technologies This has led to the development of UAVs UAVs can be flown with the assistance of an operator on the ground or completely autonomously using the onboard autopilot and a preprogrammed mission To allow for unforeseen circumstances this programming can be done before the mission or even updated during the mission UAVs come in many different types and designs from large commercial sized fixed wing or vertical takeoff aircraft to micro sized aircraft with wing spans of less than 15 cm weighing less than 50 grams[13 The papers 14 15 and 16 confirm that UAVs have been used for a wide variety of applications including wildfire reconnaissance 3 


Large UA V Systems-Large UAVs have a mass of greater than 1 OOOkgs They are now becoming a well established part of the aviation industry including fire monitoring[17 Figure 5 ALTUS II UAV fire monitoring platform 17 This is because they do not need any major innovations in computing or communications to enable them to perform their missions Large UAV like the Altair in Figure 5 are impractical for cost sensitive civilian applications due to their expense lack of availability at peak fire times and the amount of support they require[9 Therefore the next section will explore the use of small low cost UAVs for the proposed hotspot detection system Small UA V Systems Small UAV platforms generally weight less than 25 kg and have wingspans smaller than 3 meters[16 The smaller UAVs such as the Intellitech Vector-P UAV shown in Figure 6 can perform similar tasks to large ones but with much lower capital and running costs They are also lightweight small in storage size as well as quick and easy to assemble launch and operate[13 These features and their performance characteristics make small UAVs ideal for impromptu detection and tracking missions[16 They would make a good information gathering platform in areas too dangerous for expensive aircraft or human pilots and are therefore ideal for investigation in this research Figure 6 Microsystems Vector-P UAV A major disadvantage of small UAVs is the amount of computational power which can be provided to algorithms due to their limitations on payload weight and power consumption Field programmable technology is much more power efficient than commodity processors and conventional software for applications typically implemented on small UAVs[16 They will thus be investigated in the next section to help minimise the power usage requirements of the system while maximising its processing power and flexibility Reconfigurable Technology Field programmable technology devices can be configured in the field by the end user to create logic hardware solutions These devices have become very popular over the past decade as they do not require the high engineering costs and long manufacturing lead times of application specific integrated circuits ASICs We are interested in them for this research because of the significant performance advantage they can provide over general purpose computing platforms and the fact that many of the algorithms used onboard the UAV will have a very high computational complexity Reconfigurable Computing RC General purpose computing platforms are unsuited to processing large amounts of image data at high speeds[18 due to the serial nature of their processes[19 Software implementations on general computing platforms are therefore too slow and impractical for real time computer vision applications[20 Implementing complex computational tasks in hardware using ASICs can yield significant increases in performance from parallelism and pipelining[21 This is often overshadowed by long design times high non-reoccurring engineering costs and the inability to be able to modify a design after fabrication[22 The major drawback of not being able to modify the design after fabrication is that each of the applications to be used on the UAV would require the possible addition of another costly ASIC[19 This would ultimately add to the power usage physical size weight and complexity of the hardware architecture making ASICs unsuited for our research It is generally agreed in the literature that a reconfigurable computer is a computing machine that incorporates programmable logic devices to create the hardware architecture together with a traditional von-Neumann based microprocessor for the execution of software[23 This provides the ability to exploit the general purpose processor's flexibility and the reconfigurable device's capability to implement application specific computations[19 Reconfigurable computing achieves a much higher performance than software while maintaining a higher level of flexibility than hardware[23 It therefore fills a niche between hardware and software[24 4 


A unique feature of programmable logic devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs is known as dynamic or runtime reconfiguration RTR RTR is the swapping or reconfiguration of different circuits as they are needed during program execution[23 This is a significant advantage because it eliminates the need for an individual ASIC for each application and therefore the consumption of unnecessary space power and payload capacity This is ideal for the proposed hotspot detection system as FPGAs and RTR will help overcome the UAV's limitations in payload and power capabilities In the next section a summary of computer vision and image processing will be presented as they are a major application area for UAVs and reconfigurable computing Image processing is an integral part of the hotspot detection system as the UAV's onboard processing of infrared and visual bushfire data will enable the system to detect and monitor any hotspots in the area of interest Computer Vision Computer vision is the processing of images or video to recover useful information It involves highly computationally complex and intensive processing of images to recover this information[20 Computer vision can also be described as the detection localization tracking and classification of objects autonomously by a computer system under changing real world conditions These changing conditions include moving or stationary objects changing illumination conditions and panning or movement of the sensor package[25 This section investigates computer vision techniques which have previously been used for tracking with infrared imagery with the aim of highlighting the lack of literature on algorithms for identifying bushfire hotspots Image Processing Computer manipulation of images is also defined as Digital Image Processing DIP Images can be considered a 2 dimensional array of pixels with the number of pixels in width and pixels in height denoting the size and spatial resolution of an image[26 The amount of computational processing power required in DIP is a function of image resolution frame rate and the number of objects in the scene[19 The amount of processing power required also increases as the amount of clutter in a scene and the computational complexity of the algorithm used increase[19 DIP is used for image enhancement video surveillance image fusion target recognition and tracking Some of the main algorithms used in DIP include filtering morphological operations convolution edge detection and contrast enhancement[22 DIP can be done in a number of different light wavebands including infrared The visible part of the electromagnetic EM spectrum is the part the EM spectrum that humans can see The visible part of the EM spectrum ranges from violet with a wavelength of 0.38 micrometers pm to red with a wavelength of 0.74 ptm and makes up a very small part of EM spectrum are used in numerous diverse applications to enable us to sense or detect things that can't normally be seen with the naked eye The most useful waveband of the EM spectrum for heat or fire detection is the infrared waveband of light which has a wavelength from 0.75 ptm to 1 milimeter mm  and is discussed in more detail in the next section Infrared Imaging The property of infrared radiation IR where its intensity correlates to the temperature of an object is very useful for the detection of heat sources such as fires Smoke from fires can be very dangerous due to smoke inhalation and its propensity to obscure visibility Lack of visibility makes monitoring and fighting fires difficult by conventional means This is illustrated in the top image of Figure 7 where smoke completely obscures the fire from the satellite in the visual spectrum A way to overcome this problem is through the use of infrared imaging The infrared image in the bottom of Figure 7 clearly shows the fires heat signature through the smoke Figure 7 Satellite Visual Waveband top and Infrared Waveband bottom Images of the January 2005 Eyre Peninsula Bushfires[28 Since IR is outside the visible EM spectrum it is not ordinarily visible to humans and therefore a sensing device is required for us to make use of it IR cameras typically are digital cameras with sensing arrays made up of photodiodes which are responsive to a portion of the IR component of the EM spectrum[29 In an IR camera infrared radiation falls on the sensor array which transforms it into data usable by humans The IR is normally represented as visible light and can be view directly on a display or stored in digital form for additional processing or later viewing as shown in Figure 8 5 


In IR photos an object's heat is displayed using the visual spectrum with the brightest parts of the picture being the hottest and the darkest parts the coldest In Figure 8a a boy is holding a hot cup in his right hand and a cold bottle in his left In Figure 8b infrared imaging is being used by law enforcement to track and apprehend a suspect at night from a helicopter equipped with an IR camera Figure 8 a Boy holding a hot mug and a cold bottle 30 b Suspect caught using infrared technology 31 It has been demonstrated in 32 that infrared imagery is useful for detecting and tracking forest fires through the IR they emit Detecting heat sources through their IR signature makes IR cameras ideal for use in our hotspot detection system This is because even if a hotspot is not visible to the naked eye it can still be detected through the heat it radiates Image Fusion Image Fusion is an image processing technique where two or more images are combined algorithmically to create a new composite image with increased information content The original images can come from various sensors such as visible infrared x-ray radar magnetic resonance or ultrasonic sensors[33 When the images are combined in the image fusion process the resulting image gives easier to interpret and more information than the separate images did before image fusion[33 We therefore propose that combining IR imagery with visual spectrum imagery of the same scene will improve the accuracy of detecting and tracking hotspots The two main categories of image fusion are pixel based and feature based fusion In pixel based fusion the pixels at the same position in each input image are combined based on the average value of the input pixels This produces an output image which is relatively simple to implement in software on general computing platforms In feature based or wavelet fusion the pixels are combined based on the context of the pixel or the value of surrounding pixels and the pixels position in the frame This comparison of pixel values is computational intensive making it difficult to perform in real time in software on general computing platforms The feature based image fusion algorithm is decomposable making it readily parallelizable This enables it to take advantage of the strengths of reconfigurable computing and FPGA architecture providing the performance required for real time processing of these images on the hotspot tracking system[33 Image fusion will therefore be used in this system for the reduction of hotspot detection and tracking errors with the use of both the visual and infrared wavebands to classify a hotspot and eliminate false positives and negatives It will also be used to give fire fighters a visual representation of the area of interest in visual infrared or combined formats as required in near real time Visual Tracking-Visual tracking is described as one or more imaging sensors observing processing and generating a series of images that predict where the tracked objects will be from one image frame to the next[34 It has numerous civilian security and military applications including surveillance reconnaissance autonomous vehicle navigation border security target tracking object recognition face recognition resource exploration image enhancement traffic monitoring chemical spill monitoring as well as wild fire detection and monitoring[19 It is also one of the most computationally demanding tasks in computer vision and is therefore prohibitive to implement on low power general PC type microprocessors This is due to the serial nature of their processes and the parallel nature of image processing for computer vision[19 There are 3 main types of algorithms commonly used to perform tracking in computer vision These are particle filters edge detection and correlation tracking These algorithms will be explored as part of this research to find the best suited for detecting and monitoring Hotspots They will all be implemented on the FPGA proposed for the hotspot detection systems Their performance at detecting and tracking a hotspot from infrared and visual aerial and image fusion video will then be measured This will find the best algorithm for detecting and tracking of a hotspot from a UAV which will be implemented in the proposed hotspot detection system The next section looks at data collection and test requirements to enable the characterisation and autonomous detection of hotspots 3 HOTSPOTS Hotspots are defined as smouldering embers or firebrands left in the wake of a bushfire that have the potential to reignite the fire Although hotspots have been recognised as a significant problem in bushfire fighting there is little research on characterisation of them The publications 35],[36 and 37 are representative of research in this area which look at the behaviour and causes of fire firebrands and smouldering combustion rather than how hotspots can be automatically identified The papers 38 39 and 32 do look at characterisation of fire and smouldering combustion through infrared imaging but they do not specifically look at hotspots Therefore hotspot characterisation and detection will be key areas of interest for this research 6 


Characterisation To detect and locate hotspots it will be necessary to quantitatively describe them To accomplish this IR and visual spectrum video data of bushfires and hotspots will be gathered and processed The characteristics that enable hotspots to be automatically discriminated from the assorted clutter and the background of this video will then be established It has been shown in 40 that the average black body temperature or IR intensity of a pixel can be used to detect sub pixel size fires from satellite imagery We propose that the average black body temperature and IR intensity of a hotspot will also facilitate its automatic detection using an IR camera from the air We therefore intend to explore this approach for the detection of hotspots in this research We also intend to seek other characteristics useful for defining hotspots and reducing hotspot detection errors through experimentation The characteristics found through this process will then be used in the implementation of the image processing algorithms These algorithms will then be tested to find the best performing algorithm for use in the proposed hotspot detection system The criteria we will use for finding and developing the best hotspot detecting and tracking algorithm are outlined in the next section Hotspot Detection and Tracking There are numerous different types of image processing and tracking algorithms that could be used with the hotspot detection system This section describes selection criteria developed for measuring algorithm performance at detecting and tracking hotspots This will enable the implementation of the best performing and most suited algorithms for our proposed hotspot detection system The algorithms will be required to detect and locate hotspots in real time while processing the airborne UAV platforms infrared and visual sensor data This means that the implementation of these algorithms must be able to adhere to the UAV payload capacity and power consumption constraints The performance of the algorithms in detecting hotspots will need to be measurable meaningful and reliable They will also need to produce minimum of tracking errors including false positives and negatives The algorithm selection criteria were developed through discussion with stakeholders literature review and from the requirements of the hotspot detection system described in section 4 of this paper These criteria are the algorithms accuracy decomposability processing speed and suitability Suitability This criterion requires that an algorithm has the capability to detect and discriminate a hotspot from its surroundings using IR and visual sensor data The criterion also requires that an algorithm is suitable for implementation on the system's FPGA architecture This is due to the area usage clock rate and power consumption constraints of the system's UAV platform The chosen algorithm will therefore need to be able to produce the processing speed and accuracy required by the hotspot detection system while still conforming to the limitations Accuracy This criterion requires that an algorithm detect hotspots with the minimum number of false positives or negatives It must also accurately calculate the position of a hotspot with an error rate of no higher than 26120 meters from an altitude of 500 meters These conditions take into account the accuracy of the system's sensor equipment and its GPS while still being accurate enough to allow fire fighters to easily locate and extinguish hotspots Processing speed This criterion requires that an algorithm's processing speed be close to video frame rates This ensures the displaying of hotspot information at near real time The computational execution speed of an algorithm in terms of frame rate must be over 2 frames per second This sensor data processing rate was established from a literature review of image tracking on FPGA devices and has been agreed with stakeholders Decomposability This criterion requires that an algorithm minimise the number clock cycles required for processing through pipelining and parallelization Decomposability is required for the algorithms to be implemented on the system's FPGA hardware and have the ability to detect and track hotspots at near video frame rates This criterion is therefore closely related to the performance and suitability criteria The data collection and testing methods for characterisation algorithm selection and the hotspot detection system as a whole are outlined in the next section Data Collection and Testing The data collection and testing for this research will be conducted in 3 phases The first phase will be the collection of data for the characterisation of hotspots The second phase will be the collection of aerial IR and visual spectrum data of simulated and actual fires and hotspots This data will be used for development and testing of algorithms to find the best algorithm for detecting and tracking of hotspots for our proposed system The third phase involves the testing of the prototype hotspots detection system in simulated and real world conditions All simulated hotspots fires test flights and experiments will comply with all safety and legislative requirements Phase 1 Hotspot Data This phase of data collection and testing involves the collection of data on simulated and real hotspots This data will be used to quantitatively describe hotspots so that they can be automatically identified from IR and visual sensor data Fire temperature prediction and consequently hotspot detection is complex because actual fire temperature can be affected by the fuel type fuel moisture density of combustibles and atmospheric conditions[40 To achieve 7 


the quantification of hotspots we propose to run a number of experiments that measure the average blackbody temperature and IR intensity of hotspots of different compositions and dimensions The experiments will therefore need to record the hotspot's material type dimensions mass and distance from the sensing devices The current temperature humidity wind speed and direction time date location and the duration of the experiment will need to be documented these variables are also required to make experiments accurate and repeatable The minimum dimensions of embers that have been found in the literature to have the potential to ignite a fire are 25mm in diameter and 8 mm thick 37 41 therefore we will use these dimensions for hotspot simulations in our research The materials used to simulate a hotspot will include typical soft and hard wood timbers found in Australia In addition we will investigate the use of charcoal and an IR lamp as other ways to simulate a hotspot The experiments will consist of an IR lamp or small controlled fires that produce either burning wood embers or glowing coals The test bed that will record the information required to enable us to characterise hotspots will consist of a visual spectrum Sony IPELA SNC-P 1 Network digital video camera and a Thermoteknix Miricle 11 OKS infrared spectrum digital camera It will also contain a GPS and sensors that detect the current local atmospheric and weather conditions similar to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Radiosonde weather balloon sensor package The characterisation experiments will be conducted on the ground at varying distances between sensor packages and the simulated hotspots These distances will vary incrementally beginning at the minimum safe distance from a hotspot less than 10 m to a distance greater than 500 m to facilitate the finding of the optimal operational altitude for the hotspot detection system s UAV platform Phase 2 Data collection and Test Flights This phase involves the gathering of aerial IR and visual spectrum data of simulated and actual hotspots These test flights will simulate an uninhabited aerial vehicle UAV mission to detect hotspots They will be conducted in collaboration with the SA CFS and their timing will be wholly dependent on their scheduling weather conditions and fire restrictions The test flights will fly over CFS controlled fuel reduction bums training exercises or simulated hotspots The aircraft used in this flight will be either a hired helicopter or light aircraft mounted with our sensor packages The aircraft will gather IR and visual spectrum video as well as GPS positioning data of any fires and hotspots encountered during the flight The data collected during these test flights will be used to determine  The Vector P UAV aircraft's suitability for these types of flight operations  The infrared camera's characteristics and response to real world fire conditions  The optimum height direction and speed for the UAV to fly over a fire and hotspots when gathering data  The best most suited image processing and tracking algorithm to implement in the hotspot detection system Phase 3 System Testing This phase involves two stages of testing The first stage is the calibrating and testing the complete system and the second stage is proving the system under real bushfire conditions This phase's first stage of testing involves actual UAV flights over fires and hotspots to allow for testing and calibration of the whole hotspot detection system This testing stage aims to prove that the system can detect and track hotspots as per our hypothesis This stage's testing is similar to the phase two test flights except that the sensor packages will be integrated in to the Vector-P UAV platform instead of hired piloted aircraft This will then confirm if the complete system can perform as per the system's requirements These test flights will fly over CFS controlled fuel reduction burns training exercises or simulated hotspots They will therefore need to be conducted in conjunction with the CFS and the timing of them will again be dependent on the CFS's scheduling weather conditions and fire restrictions The final testing stage involves the testing of the system in actual bushfire conditions This is where the hotspot detection system will fly the perimeter of a number of actual bushfires looking for hotspots The number of hotspots detected the accuracy of the detection and the time taken to detect hotspots will be measured and compare to the current method of detection These results will be compared for a number of bushfires to test our hypothesis that the proposed hotspot detection system based on UAVs RC and image processing techniques will facilitate the detection and location of hotspots form the air in real time and under real world conditions thus enabling fire fighters to extinguish hotspots before they can ignite into a bushfire It will also test our assertion that the proposed hotspot detection system's performance will surpass that of the current methods of hotspot detection The next section describes the hotspot detection system's requirements and proposed composition which this testing endeavours to validate 4 HOTSPOT DETECTION SYSTEM This section looks at the requirements for the hotspot detection system and then goes on to describe the system It proposes a system that meets these requirements and the 8 


needs and expectations of the stakeholders in this project It also outlines the system's components technologies and functions based on these considerations Requirements This section describes the bushfire monitoring system's requirements developed through consultation with the interested parties of this project including the CFS They expressed their keen interest in a system that gives them near real time information on smouldering embers which have the potential to ignite into a fire They believe that this will help them fight fires in a safer and more effective manner The requirements developed through this consultation are that the hotspot detection system  Be relatively inexpensive when compared to other types of bushfire monitoring systems such as satellite piloted aircraft or large UAVs  Be reliable robust and lightweight with low power consumption  Have the payload capacity to carry the required communications processing and sensing hardware  Have reasonable flight time and range  Be setup launched and operated by CFS personnel within 2 to 3 hours of notification of a fire outbreak  Fly autonomously by remote control or via a preplanned flight path as well as being able to switch between these modes as required throughout a mission  Automatically detect and track any hotspots in the area of interest  Gather video data of hotspots in both the infrared and visual spectrums  Process the hotpot data in both visual and infrared spectrums in near real time  Communicate any data collected and processed to the CFS incident command in near real time  Display the UAV's information for CFS incident command to allow for remote piloting if required  Display the true position of any fire and hotspots in the area of interest  Display the current local area weather and wind information of the area of interest  Display the infrared visual and image fusion video of the fire and hotspots as required  Display the required hotspot and fire information over digital maps of the local area to help give it context if desired  Provide a user interface that is easy to use understand and that aids the CFS in the decision making and fire fighting process The next section describes the hotspot detection system that meets the above requirements System Description This section takes the requirements from the previous section and proposes a hotspot detection system that meets these requirements and the needs and expectations of the stakeholders in this project The hotspot detection system will consist of a general computing platform such as a laptop This computing platform will be located at CFS incident command It will contain the user interface for the system and a database of all necessary digital maps It will also have the ability to retrieve local weather and wind information The system's user interface will be designed to be easy to use understand and to help the CFS in fire fighting and the decision making process The system will display the position of any hotspots in the current search area It will also provide video streams of these hotspots in infrared visual and image fusion formats The system will display collated local weather and wind information The system will additionally display the UAV flight data to enable the remote piloting of the UAV if required The system will furthermore present CFS incident command with this information in real time All this information will be presented either individually collectively or as visual representations on digital maps of the fire area This will reduce the cognitive load on the user of the system thus providing effortless perception of the information in an easy to understand context The system will therefore facilitate fighting fires in a safer and more effective manner As stated previously one of the best ways to gather information about bushfires is from the air However this can be ineffective and even perilous for pilots due to high unpredictable winds hazardous terrain as well as smoke obscuring both the fire and the terrain This research will provide fire fighters with real-time information they require without risking expensive aircraft or pilot's lives in these dangerous conditions This aim can be achieved by using a relatively inexpensive autonomous UAV 42 equipped with FPGA hardware for image processing from infrared and visual sensor packages This UAV platform will use this payload to acquire process and then transmit the required information to the fire fighters displaying hotspots even when obscured by smoke This ensures that they can 9

5 CONCLUSION The paper first highlighted the problem of bushfires and the need for research into detection and tracking of hotspots It defined a hotspot as a firebrand or smouldering ember that has the potential to ignite a fire It then explored the current literature on bushfires bushfire monitoring fire fighting uninhabited aerial vehicles UAV reconfigurable computing RC computer vision infrared imaging and visual tracking This knowledge base in conjunction with consultation with the South Australian CFS and other interested parties was used to develop requirements for a system that can detect and track hotspots The data collection and testing for this research was described as being conducted in 3 phases The first phase is data collection for characterisation of hotspots The second phase is the collection of aerial IR and visual spectrum data used for development and testing of hotspot detection and tracking algorithms The third phase is the testing of the prototype hotspots detection system and its components in simulated and real world conditions These success criteria for hotspots detection and tracking algorithms were defined as the algorithms accuracy decomposability processing speed and suitability The requirements of the hotspot detection system are that it be inexpensive reliable robust and lightweight when compared to other types of bushfire monitoring systems such as satellite piloted aircraft or large UAVs The system is able to be setup launched and operated by CFS personnel within 2 to 3 hours of notification of a fire outbreak It will automatically detect and track a hotspot in the wake of a fire It can communicate this data to the CFS incident command in near real time It displays the infrared visual and image fusion video of the hotspot as required It will have a user interface that is easy to use understand and that aids the CFS in the decision making and fire fighting process The hotspot detection system and its components were described The requirements were then used to justify the choice of these components and technologies in the hotspot detection system 6 FUTURE WORK Future research opportunities include conducting the data collection and testing for characterising of hotspots Conducting test flights that simulate UAV hotspot detection missions using an aircraft equipped with a FLIR camera to gather the required data Then test image processing algorithms and refine them based on the test results Implement the best performing algorithm in the hotspot detection system Test the Implementation of the algorithm in the system using the available test data Undertake test flights of the UAV platform to obtain and refine the system's optimal mission performance requirements for detecting and monitoring of bushfires Implement the communications infrastructure of the bushfire monitoring system Develop and implement the user interface of the of system Test the final prototype of the hotspot detection system Implement a swarm of UAVs for the system to giving the system a wider coverage area longer mission durations and more flexibility Develop a distributed operating system utilising the UAVs onboard FPGAs to control and reconfigure the UAV swarm completely autonomously or with communications from the system's base station Expand the system to implement full bushfire monitoring REFERENCES 1 EMA 2005 Eyre Peninsula Bushfire Emergency Management Australia\(EMA Attorney-General's Department Australian Government Canberra 26th July 2007  2 Tsikas M 2006 Fire fighters protect houses from a bushfire on the Central Coast of NSW on New Year's day Photograph Epoch Times Australia viewed 5th October 2006 3 ABS 2004 1301.0 Year Book Australia 2004 Bushfires Australian Bushfire Statistics 2004 updated 24 March 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics ABS Canberra viewed 23rd May 2007  4 McAneney J.K 2005 Australian bushfire Quantifying and pricing the risk to residential properties paper presented at the Symposium on Planning for Natural Hazards How Can We Mitigate the Impacts University of Wollongong 2-5 February 2005 5 Rodriguez Y Silva F and A Moreno Robles EUFIRELAB Euro-Mediterranean Wildland Fire Laboratory a wall-less Laboratory for Wildland Fire Sciences and Technologies in the EuroMediterranean Region The infrared imager its use for wildland fire monitoring D-09-04 2006 EUFIRELAB p 30 6 Rodriguez Y Silva F EUFIRELAB EuroMediterranean Wildland Fire Laboratory a wallless  Laboratory for Wildland Fire Sciences and Technologies in the Euro-Mediterranean Region Infrared imager its interest for wildland fire monitoring D-07-07 2005 EUFIRELAB p 28 the Bush fire system Develop test plan for the complete 11

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
