science opportunities A planning and scheduling component of the system enables the rover to take advantage of identified science opportunities In this paper we provide a brief overview of the entire OASIS system and then describe new system capabilities with an emphasis on the identification of novel features during a traverse This capability has been integrated into the full system and validated in field testing In addition the system has been integrated with the Visual Target Tracking VTT capability recently uploaded to the Mars Exploration Rovers VTT 
enables the system to robustly track a specified target By integrating this with the autonomous science system the rover can approach targets identified onboard and acquire targeted measurements both from additional viewing angles as well as from positions in close proximity to the target.1 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION    1 2 OASIS OVERVIEW

1449 Version 2 Updated December 13 2007 rovers endurance records and more importantly their return of such a rich treasure of in-situ scientific data Spirit has driven 7.26 kilometers 4.51 miles and has returned more than 102,000 images Opportunity see Figure 1 has driven 11.57 kilometers 7.19 miles and has returned more than 94,000 images."3 Should the rovers continue to maintain an acceptable level of productivity and operability through the martian winter the mission could well run into 2009 Now over three and a half years into the mission researchers are beginning 
to seriously consider the possible benefits that elements of autonomous science technology may bring to increasing the mission's science returns While a number of autonomous rover capabilities are currently in development for future in-situ missions onboard autonomous rover science continues to grow in importance as rover lifetime and travel distances increase OASIS 1-4 an Onboard Autonomous Science Investigation System is a JPL-managed project designed to maximize mission science on rover missions with long traverses OASIS is designed to operate onboard a rover identifying and reacting to serendipitous 
science opportunities Science opportunities can include detection of atmospheric events such as dust devils and clouds 4 and terrain features such as rocks with novel properties that the rover has not seen before 1 OASIS analyzes data the rover gathers and then prioritizes the data based on criteria set by the science team At the next opportunity for transmitting data back to Earth the data is already prioritized ensuring that the most valuable data is sent first As OASIS is working to prioritize the data it is also searching 
for specific targets it has been told to find by the science team 1 If one of these targets is found it is identified as a new science opportunity and a science alert is sent to the planning and scheduling component of OASIS After reviewing the rover's current operational status to ensure that it has enough resources to complete its traverse and act on the new science opportunity OASIS changes the command sequence of the rover to gather additional measurements of the target of interest 1 3 1 


The rover is instructed to stop its current traverse locate the rock that triggered the science alert and take additional data e.g color image closer grayscale image spectrometer reading on that rock In addition the system now enables the rover to either turn and collect data on the identified target rock or to drive to the target so that closer measurements can be collected Once it has completed this additional measurement the rover reverts back to its original plan and continues on its traverse classified onboard represent outliers as compared to the rocks that have historically been seen This discovery of the novel rock will also trigger a science alert As resources permit OASIS can instruct the rover to point to this target take some close-up data and then return the data to Earth at its next communication cycle Going beyond searching for targets whose characteristics match those provided by the science team the rover can now search for novel rocks rocks that once analyzed and Figure 1 As of sol 1308 Sept 28 2007 Opportunity's total odometry was 11,572.94 meters 7.19 miles 


The OASIS system includes three primary components In Section 2 we briefly describe the system and these components Section 3 outlines how the novelty detector identifies rocks that are dissimilar from any rocks seen previously How the combined use of OASIS and VTT enables autonomous target selection and rover approach to within 1-2 meters of a target location is outlined in Section 4 Finally related work is in Section 5 and a summary is presented in Section 6 2 OASIS OVERVIEW To assess and subsequently prioritize the scientific value of a set of collected images we must first extract the information found within the images A geologist in the field gets information about a site by identifying geologic features including the albedo texture shape size color and arrangement of rocks and features of the topography such as layers in a cliff face The geologist analyzes and assesses this data and then takes some action based on the analysis such as taking a sample or taking some additional measurement of an interesting rock In order for scientists to allow an autonomous system to help investigate the traversed region the system must be able to perform albeit in a very simple way these same types of functions This system thus is used to point out rocks or other objects of interest to the scientist There are three major components that comprise OASIS  Extract Features from Images Enables extraction of features of interest from collected images of the surrounding terrain This module both locates rocks in the images and extracts rock properties features including shape size texture and albedo  Analyze and Prioritize Data Uses the extracted features to assess the scientific value of the planetary scene and to generate new science objectives that will further contribute to this assessment This module consists of three separate prioritization algorithms that analyze the collected data and prioritize the rocks A new set of observation goals is generated to gather further data on rocks that either conform to the pre-set specifications by the science team or are so novel in comparison to the other rocks that another data measurement may be required Image analysis when used on a sequence of images taken in a stationary position for cloud or dust devil observation campaigns can also be used to identify motion an indication of a cloud moving or a dust devil moving across the field of view 4  Plan and Schedule New Command Sequence Enables dynamic modification of the current rover command sequence or plan to accommodate new science requests from the data analysis and prioritization module A continuous planning approach is used to iteratively adjust the plan as new goals occur while ensuring that resource and other operation constraints are met 3 NOVELTY DETECTION During a rover traverse OASIS acquires Navcam and Hazcam images periodically When an image is acquired it is analyzed to identify rocks in the image and for each rock geologically salient features including albedo size eccentricity and angularity shape and orientation are determined Each rock and its features are added to an onboard database that records the history of the traverse In previous field tests OASIS has utilized its traverse database to select rocks that meet a specific criteria or target signature A target signature is determined by scientists on the ground before or even during a traverse and is uplinked to the rover If a rock or set of rocks is found that meets a target signature e.g smooth with a high albedo the rover will prioritize that rock for downlink or in the case of an extremely high priority target signature attempt to collect additional science measurements While searching for rocks with specific characteristics has been successful in field tests and well received by scientists it has an obvious downside potentially interesting rocks that do not meet the target signature criteria will be missed To address this issue and complement the OASIS target signature capability we have developed and demonstrated onboard novelty detection The OASIS novelty detector identifies rocks that are dissimilar from any rocks seen previously It utilizes the same historical traverse database as our target signature capability However instead of searching for specific rocks as in the target signature case the novelty detector i groups rocks based on feature similarity and then ii searches for statistical outliers from those groups Intuitively this has the effect of identifying and prioritizing for downlink the most novel rocks For example a novelty detector that utilized albedo or VISNIR spectral signature would identify a calcite as novel in a sea of martian basalts It's important to note that our novelty detector operates without any prior knowledge from scientists or operators by design The novelty detector groups rocks based on feature similarity To perform this grouping rock features are treated as points in N-dimensional space and then clustered using the unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm The number of clusters k signifies the number of geologic rock groups a geologist might expect to encounter on a traverse 3 


Figure 2 The top images were acquired one meter apart at the beginning of the traverse The bottom left image is a repeat of the top right with rocks labeled in cyan The novelty detector found one of the dike remnants an upright rock labeled in yellow As a result of the novelty detection OASIS altered the traverse plan to approach the rock and acquire and additional measurement image bottom right before resuming its original traverse For simple novelty detection when operating on only a few rock features and/or on a relatively short traverse it is sufficient to set k to 1 Once the N-dimensional points representing rock features have been clustered into one or more groups statistical outliers are selected by choosing points rocks at least three standard deviations away from the cluster center\(s Rocks that pass this threshold test are considered novel and ranked by their distance from cluster centers i.e the farther away from a cluster center the greater the degree of novelty Figure 2 We demonstrated OASIS novelty detection in the JPL Mars Yard with the FIDO rover shown in Figure 3 on several traverses In the first scenario we turned two basalt rocks upright to represent remnants of weathered and worn dikes The majority of the rocks situated in the yard are longer than they are tall so the two obelisk-like upright rocks appeared to the human-eye to be novel We set the novelty detector to operate on two rock features in our traverse database eccentricity 0.0-1.0 with 0.0 being round and 1.0 represented elongated and orientation 0-180 degrees with respect to the ground As our traverse was short and the number of rock features small we set k to 1 Navcam images were acquired every meter We conducted several independent traverses with these settings In every traverse one or both of the upright rocks were detected and identified as novel by the OASIS novelty detector Figure 2 In a second more limited study we examined Navcam traverse images that contained one to a few high albedo rocks amidst a field of several times as many low albedo rocks This rock configuration was meant to simulate calcites in a sea of martian basalts Since the JPL rovers do not have a spectrometer onboard we relied solely on albedo as an indicator of mineral content To that end the novelty detector was set to operate on rock albedo from the traverse database In every test case the high albedo rock\(s was 4 


detected and identified as novel by the OASIS novelty Figure 3 JPL FIDO rover detector 4 AUTONOMOUS TARGET SELECTION TRACKING AND SAMPLING Previously the OASIS system has been shown to enable autonomous targeting for remote science measurements that cannot be easily selected in advance Remote sensing instruments typically take measurements from a distance and are located on a rover mast such as the MER Panoramic Cameras and Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer mini-TES This year OASIS was shown to enable autonomous target selection for targets that require either close-contact or near-proximity measurements Towards this goal the OASIS system was integrated with the MER Visual Target Tracking VTT software 6 which enables a rover to track a selected target as the rover drives and to closely approach a target location The combined use of OASIS and VTT enables autonomous target selection and rover approach to within 1-2 meters of a target location This level of approach already supports close-proximity measurements where the rover must be within a certain number of meters of a target to acquire a good measurement e.g due to occlusions or instrument range Follow-on steps for close-contact sampling would be target handoff to the rover hazard cameras rover base placement to within 1 meter of target and sample acquisition through automated instrument placement Our goal this year was to demonstrate the capabilities for automated target selection and close approach In future years we plan to integrate with the additional technologies required for close-contact measurements which have already been successfully used with VTT to enable single cycle instrument placement SCIP 7,8 Currently the typical mission operations scenario for selecting MER rover targets remote and close-contact is to 1 download image data that has been taken from the rover's current location which is often the end of a drive 2 manually identify targets on Earth using that data and then 3 uplink new measurement commands at the next opportunity which at best will happen on the next sol and may require several sols This strategy is difficult to implement if the rover is driving on most sols as has been the case over large portions of the MER missions since there is limited time to analyze the data and uplink new commands before the rover changes its location Further if the rover is driving on multiple sols between uplinks there is no current way to take targeted measurements at intermediate stopping locations since data on those locations will be downlinked in time This situation becomes more complex if the measurements need to be close-contact or require the rover to be in close proximity to the target Close contact measurements can provide a wealth of science knowledge for planetary environments and are one of the most important elements of a surface mission On the MER rover mission it typically requires a minimum of two to three sols to place an instrument for a close contact measurement Further these measurements can only be collected when the rover can remain at one site for an extended period allowing time for imaging downlink of images to Earth target selection by scientists and uplink/execution of desired measurement sequences New technology has been uploaded to the MER rovers such as VTT and automated instrument placement that can reduce the overall collection time however targets must still typically be selected on Earth using image data that was downlinked from a previous sol To test OASIS technology for automated target selection and handling in conjunction with VTT we have done a large amount of testing with the FIDO rover in the JPL Mars Yard For this testing we employed the integrated system shown in Figure 3 and used the following scenario elements The rover is commanded to drive towards a target location which represents a ground-selected science target As the rover drives images are taken with the rover's navigation cameras of the surrounding area These images are analyzed in an online fashion by the OASIS rockfinder and rocks in the scene are autonomously identified Next a subset of those rocks are selected and prioritized based on scientist-selected criteria For this testing we primarily used the OASIS novelty detector as explained in Section 3 to prioritize potential targets but other target selection techniques could also be used If a highly interesting rock is found it is identified as a new science target and request for a new measurement is sent to the OASIS planning and schedule subsystem Since only a limited amount of time or resources will typically be available on a rover mission to take opportunistic science measurements the OASIS planning and scheduling subsystem is used to only schedule measurements that can be safely executed based on the rover health and current state Planning in OASIS is provided by the CASPER continuous planning system 9,10 An iterative optimization approach is used to schedule additional science measurements within the 5

navigation and pose estimation are provided by the CLARAty functional layer 12 The functional layer uses the D*/Morphin navigator 13 to navigate toward a commanded location The MER VTT algorithm was integrated with D*/Morphin to allow the rover to navigate safely toward a feature of interest At each step of the algorithm the rover acquires an image with the navigation cameras pointed at where it expects the feature to be It searches an area around this looking for a match with the target feature When a match is found it updates its estimate of the 3D location of the feature and updates D*/Morphin with a revised location of where the rover should go D*/Morphin acquires images to build an obstacle map and searches for a path toward this location The rover drives a step along this path typically about 1 meter and repeats the process This continues until the rover reaches a requested standoff distance from the target Upon completion of a drive the functional layer updates the executive on the status of the task indicating whether or not it was successful in reaching the target The executive relays this information to the OASIS planner which updates the plan based on this information If the traverse activity was successful it will then proceed to performing the data collection If the traverse was unsuccessful one or more conflicts will appear in the plan and the planner will have to repair these before it can send the data acquisition activity to the executive Figure 4 shows an example new-measurement goal sent to the system from the onboard science analysis algorithm that has detected a novel rock The figure shows a series of images that were collected by the functional layer as it used VTT to move toward the novel rock along with the final image that was collected 5 RELATED WORK The new currently operational autonomous dust devil and cloud detection capability onboard the MER rovers 4,14 is an early demonstration of benefits that can be achieved with onboard science event detection The Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment ASE 15 has demonstrated the capability of planning and data analysis systems to autonomously coordinate behavior of the EO1 Earth orbiting satellite ASE can also detect and respond to new science events however it uses different detection and analysis algorithms Further since ASE were applied to an orbiter it does not handle issues associated with the uncertainty of surface navigation A number of planning and executive systems have been used for robotic applications and have some similarities to the approach we describe in this paper One approach directed towards rover command generation used a Contingent Planner/Scheduler CPS that was developed to schedule rover science operations using a Contingent Rover Language CRL 16 CRL allows both temporal flexibility and contingency branches in rover command sequences Contingent sequences are produced by the CPS planner and then are interpreted by an executive which executes the final plan by choosing sequence branches based on current rover conditions As compared to OASIS only the executive is onboard the rover planning is a ground-based operation and does not involve re-planning Since only a limited number of contingencies can be anticipated and incorporated into the plan CRL does not provide as much flexibility as OASIS when adjusting the sequence in response to unexpected events The LAAS-CNRS lab robotic control architecture 17 also uses onboard planning and execution to create initial plans and to provide re-planning capabilities However as compared to CASPER the IxTeT planner uses a partial order CSP-based planning approach which can require larger amounts of time for re-planning since a valid plan must be found at every search step Further this system has not addressed the handling of opportunistic science and interacting with an onboard data analysis system 6 SUMMARY There are significant potential benefits to using onboard science for rover missions The practicality of onboard science with current missions has been demonstrated with the automated detection of dust devils on the MER rovers The extended OASIS system has been demonstrated on field test rovers with extensive testing in the JPL Mars Yard In addition to identification of the signatures of features known to be scientifically interesting it is important to be able to identify unusual or novel features that may be encountered This capability has now be fully integrated into the OASIS system and demonstrated with extensive testing While previously the system has focused on the opportunistic data using remote sensing by integration with the VTT capability additional information can be gathered as the rover approaches targets that have been identified from a distance With continued success of current and future surface operations the benefits of onboard science increase The OASIS system under the guidance and direction of scientists continues to expand its capabilities to better provide the tools for increasing mission science return 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
