Contextualized Search and Faceted Browsing of Heterogeneous ISS Mission Operations Data Christopher D Knight Jane T Malin National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA Johnson Space Center Code TI Mail Stop 269-4 2101 NASA Parkway Moffett Field CA 9403 5-1000 Houston TX 77058 650-604-3471 jane.t.malin\(nasa.gov Christopher.D.Knight\(nasa.gov Abstract This paper 2 details a full-text search interface developed to support mission operators to quickly search across multiple databases simultaneously and allow for search result refinement using a faceted user interface By leveraging 
the contextualized NETMARK[1 eXtensible DataBase XDB this search interface automatically infers categories for facets and allows users to select one or more category for each facet to narrow the results to only display those that meet all of the selected facet categories TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 APPROACH 5 3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  6 4 RESULTS 6 4 CONCLUSION 7 5 BIOGRAPHIES 8 6 REFERENCES 8 1 INTRODUCTION The immense success of commercial search systems such as those deployed at Google 
Amazon eBay and other top-tier search and commerce sites illustrate the demand from endusers for convenient and expedient access to the relevant information or products the user seeks Naive and sophisticated users of search systems today demand a simple easy-to-use search mechanism within which they can type in words identifiers or phrases of interest and the results are presented with the least amount of effort by the user These users expect relevant results and the ability to iteratively fine-tune their results usually by adding more terms to the 
search phrase Search Context Generalized search systems for searching multiple Internet or Intranet sites are generally limited in their ability to control the context of their search based upon fragments of the URL addressing space such as host name and path of the pages indexed This capability is particularly powerful 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 
C 2008 IEEE U.S Government work not protected by U.S copyright 2IEEEAC paper 1091 Version 2 Updated 2007:10:20 for users familiar with a subset of web sites that contain the information most relevant 
to them and most likely to address the questions asked through search Additional document contexts are often available depending on the types of systems indexed For example map systems can be searched on geographical or data set contexts message boards can be searched on author date or other relevant metadata For search systems that do not have a-priori knowledge of the structure and metadata of the data they are indexing they are unable to retrieve results based on more refined contexts For example searching the Internet for Christopher 
D Knight will return a large number of results but if the user was interested in papers on which Mr Knight were the author and the user was able to limit the search to the Authors section of documents it would significantly narrow the number of results to a more manageable and relevant set Leveraging additional contexts such as site say IEEE sites would increasingly target the results for further accuracy Incremental Refinement of Search While sophisticated users may already have preconceived contexts for 
their searches most users find complex grammars or user interfaces to be a barrier to use of the search system Instead this paper proposes an incremental refinement approach wherein the user performs a simple keyword search across all contexts and post search refines the results to narrow them to a smaller relevant set Incremental refinement has additional benefits the user may want to explore the larger space of results and may find results that are relevant but not necessarily in the contexts the user expected Or the user 
may not know the context\(s until they perform the initial search Sophisticated experienced users if given the choice to narrow the search before exploring may miss relevant results Using the previous example if a sophisticated user were able to limit the search to the Authors section of IEEE papers that user would not be aware of the instances where Mr Knight appears in the references section of the papers or that Mr Knight has a patent with the USPTO on a technology relevant to the user's interests 1

Figure 2 Current PVCS Search User Interface As illustrated in Figure 2 the existing PVCS web-based search interface is time-consuming to use and restrictive users seeking all records regarding a particular ISS subsystem or component and must perform a large number of search operations to answer a simple question such as What problems have been reported and resolved regarding GPS software Searching each set of PVCS records requires multiple user operations in a complex query interface This search interface requires selecting one database such as SCR and one or at most two fields such as the title or owner All records are presented as HTML tables for viewing with references to related records provided in the HTML tables as links NETMARK Search System Developed by a team in the Intelligent Systems Division of the NASA Ames Research Center the NETMARK system provides an environment for data integration across multiple disparate and heterogeneous repositories NETMARK combines the capability to ingest a variety of data in unstructured semi-structured and highly-structured forms with the ability to search the NETMARK index and retrieve information atoms via a rich while straightforward query language Data is integrated in NETMARK eXtensible DataBase NETMARK XDB with no a-priori knowledge of the structure and with no NETMARK configuration required It is common however to massage the data being loaded into NETMARK for increase precision of retrievals For example unstructured text Word documents HTML documents and XML documents may be loaded into NETMARK XDB directly However semantic information about the relationship between sections of text is often not explicit in less-structured formats such as HTML i.e in HTML tables As part of the NETMARK deployment Ames developed a web crawling system that automatically retrieves updated PVCS records via the web interface normalizes the table-heavy HTML into an XML structure and loads the XML into the NETMARK database Data is loaded into NETMARK XDB via the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning WebDAV[5 protocol a file-sharing protocol built on top of the HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP As files are transferred to the NETMARK XDB system they are automatically decomposed and indexed with a full-text index system and immediately available for querying and document fragment retrieval by clients and users Interacting with the NETMARK schema-less database system is performed by executing simple or compound searches using a specific grammar of context  content requests i.e searching for the content Knight under a context with Authors will produce a result set containing this and other papers where the name Knight appears in the Authors section of those documents Searches in NETMARK XDB can be as simple as a content-only search returns any context with the terms sought in the content section or compound with multiple contexts and contents 3

SCFWR 3  JlSP N The application of the NETMARK model to ISS mission operations has been an on-going project for many years and a variety of user interface prototypes have been developed These previous interfaces required the user to select a context for their search similar to the PVCS system but more powerful in that the search operation would be performed across multiple record types simultaneously For example the previous system would allow users to select the title or description context using a pull-down form element and provide search terms in a text box Documents containing the search terms in the context specified were returned However even sophisticated users were confused by the user interface when it asked to both provide a search string and pre-select a context in the case of data replicated from PVCS record field name Also of concern to the developers while it would have been possible to allow the the need to simplify and provide the bare minimum required to perform the work This simplified user interface produces a set of results in a paginated view for the client to browse through and to review individual results in detail Links to the data record in the authoritative system of record are provided for each search result akin to the links in common search service results such as Google but an expandable display of results is also available for immediate viewing In developing this simplified user interface it became apparent that the contexts of the resulting contents were available at no cost By using the NETMARK XDB system all searches produce the associated contexts for the contents found The contexts of all of the results are compiled and presented to the end-user in a faceted user interface for further refinement Each result is shown as one line of text N umber of rsulsR 44 T*pe  US  16743 13202  19178  12860 Resu taPgel20 Status CLOSED CLOSE CLOSED CLOSED NO ACTION REQUIRED NO v SCR SR A O1N RQU1RE CLOSACEDNRQS NOACTION REQU RED CLOSED CLOE NO ACTIONREQURE CL0SED NO.ACTON.REQUIRED Figure 4 NX Search Facet Ut user to select all contexts habit and familiarity with the PVCS search system would lead users to select the contexts they felt were most likely to return results and records that may be of interest may be overlooked 2 APPROACH The first approach to addressing ease of use was to provide a simple user interface with a single text input field and perform a content-only search of the database with the words and phrases provided Repeated requests from users to make the interface as easy to use as Google reinforced but a small triangle button expands one record's display showing all of the fields recorded in NETMARK for quick review A link to the record in PVCS is also provided so that the system of record is consulted and so that users may navigate to related records in a manner familiar to regular users of PVCS Users of this system are presented with a simple search form wherein they select the type\(s of records they wish to search and a free-text field for providing terms and phrases of interest Screenshots of the user interface pages are shown in Figures 4 and 5 5  M iNON l2 E mg E  f.l  e ASCS APF ROVED 0 lN"2 NE Rela2te  sear}fches Type R SCR  SCR SR SR SCR SCR SCR SCR SCR SCR SCR In SCR F SPN N F SI G FCOH Pag X 2 ID Tite 18 92 12326 1  K..K    K  K%,t8     _ _KK..............KKKK  EIferSSuu _SSSS.X.X.X.=UUUU UUU _S.._S 1   A f,jl I f W

 Individual results may belong to more than one category under a given facet e.g if the user searched for Knight and it appeared in both the Author and Bio sections of a document that document would belong to both categories As facets and their categories are non-hierarchical and as records may belong to more than one facet the UI allows users to select multiple facet categories and they are presented with all records that belong to any of those facets Other faceted UI's rely on facet categories being hierarchical and only allow users to select an individual category under each facet  Interactions with the faceted UI are performed purely client-side for high performance The authors are unaware of any faceted user interfaces that are performed purely on the client and that provide the immediate feedback and high performance inherent in this implementation The user interface has presented some challenges and have remaining open questions including  How to handle user selections When all categories for a facet are selected and the user selects one category should all other categories be de-selected or the one selected  What numerical value to display next to each facet category current implementation shows the total number of records in that facet category but this value may be confusing when one facet has multiple categories turned off  How to handle very long facet category lists currently the lists are unordered but even when they are ordered users may seek the categories with fewest results or with the most results 4 CONCLUSION The NETMARK XDB Faceted Search user interface will continue to be improved based upon feedback provided by end-users The techniques and layout will be leveraged for other applications at NASA and other agencies It is applicable to systems that leverage the XDB server technology and semi-structured contextualized nature of the query results produced Further developments include evaluating how best to combine less-structured documents with more structured data sets such as the PVCS records They also include leveraging ontologies and taxonomies to organize and unify the display in a more logical and userfriendly fashion The technique may be easily applied to any search system that uses generated metadata to provide views of the information to be retrieved 7

9 recognition for use in critical procedure execution for checkout of space suits  7  Virtual Cockpits Current spacecraft and aircraft have cockpits where all operator input and output is concentrated Visual input from real images viewed through windows is used to fly the vehicle with control inputs from sticks and hand-controllers directly affecting control surfaces Additional flight systems information or autopilot headings can be shown in heads-up displays \(HUD or head-mounted displays HMD allowing the pilot to see both the view outside the cockpit and the ancillary information presented without changing his head position Advances in fly-by-wire and other methods allow this direct connection to be bypassed in favor of computational methods that can provide significant advantages for control stability and robustness Indeed as in the case of the Supersonic Transport cockpit windows were a real problem and virtual methods of presenting external visual information to the pilot have been investigated In this approach cameras are used to present a virtual picture to the pilot either using HUD or HMD technology Widely disseminated HSI hardware can match similarly dispersed MAA software architectures altering the need for spacecraft cockpits where information from all the vehicle\325s systems converges and from which it is controlled HSI devices can be used at any location within the spacecraft connecting to the nearest computing node using the wireless network functioning well as roaming mobile devices enabling innovative methods of HSI interaction for future spacecraft. Crewed spacecraft, in fact, can more and more be designed in the manner of remotely controlled vehicles in which the cockpit function does not need to be physically localized in one place in the vehicle and may even not be located within the vehicle at all The only time that cockpit functions are required is during transit orbit insertion trajectory corrections and orbital insertion assuming that the surface landings will be made in smaller craft During this time the crew would don virtual reality VR headsets with microphones and earphones and take out flight controls hardware which might look like computer game controllers for the pilot and commander All of the rest of the status checks and burn equipment readiness checks can be made by voice and checking the virtual reality displays Images from outside the spacecraft would be presented to the crewmembers perhaps synchronized with the visual field providing the capability for viewing the outside environment in all directions Crew location and tracking of body position are needed for taking advantage of these developments Miniaturized low power sensors and effectors may be mounted on a variety of places on the crew themselves allowing precise tracking of their position body postures and biometric status i.e heart and metabolic rate These parameters may be wirelessly transmitted to the relevant spacecraft systems allowing more accurate tracking of crew location and supporting maintenance of physical and cognitive workload within acceptable margins Moreover since these smaller head or body-mounted displays can move around with the user they open the possibility of the virtual cockpit being totally mobile and accessible anywhere within the pressurized spacecraft volume Indeed if the wireless network is appropriately configured the cockpit could even be accessed from outside the vehicle during EVA HAL9000 watch out Augmented Reality For ordinary vehicle and mission operations the crew could use alternative displays and input methods not requiring VR headsets. For example, the spacecraft could be equipped with beam forming microphone arrays and 3D spatial audio speakers capable of monitoring spoken commands and providing directional audio output directly to the crewmember This will allow the intelligent agent system to communicate with any crewmember and receive voice commands from any place in the spacecraft including the crew quarters Mobile hand-held displays or projected displays could provide a similar capability for visual information Each crewmember would have an area of responsibility and would be presented the appropriate displays hand controllers and have the appropriate voice commands available The software would implement a flexible presentation interface coupled to the workflow of the present operation with crew being able to override the default presentation At any point in time the system would be capable of answering questions displaying diagrams and procedures and showing schedules and timelines 


10 Functions for operating spacecraft systems and monitoring the progress of the mission can be done by augmented reality displays and voice commands In augmented reality information systems help crewmembers perform their duties by presenting relevant procedures in the correct time sequence along with relevant technical information drawings and pictures In effect this type of assistant knows about the task being performed using correlations to mission procedures and documentation to present the appropriate information to the crewmember at the right time or upon request The augmented reality system will have at least the following capabilities 1  Controlling avionics and information displays 2  Reminding the crew of tasks to be performed 3  Alerting the crew to off nominal and emergency conditions in the spacecraft 4  Help running diagnostic tests and conducting recovery activities in the case of failures 5  Planning and scheduling crew work activities and communications 6  Navigation and mission progress reporting 7  Procedure execution assistance 8  Robot control and monitoring 9  Medical monitoring and diagnosis 10  Communication facilitation with Earth The spoken dialogue system will be the human interface to a series of intelligent agents which will help run the spacecraft both autonomously and under human control These intelligent agents are software processes running in the computational modules acting as high-level user interfaces to the control software. Because transit and habitat spacecraft will be more complicated than previous spacecraft they will have to be largely autonomous for a small crew to operate and monitor particularly for longduration missions Since speech is a very natural communication modality for humans it will be the best interface to the spacecraft systems particularly when augmented by haptic pointing and gesture input devices and HMDs Haptic devices such as miniature finger-mounted buzzers can also be introduced to provide positive tactile feedback for operation of virtual switches and knobs The key to coherent function is to virtually connect the HSI components to the software processes needing human input and monitoring In the case of complex spacecraft this usually encompasses multiple concurrent processes with separate virtual displays for output Training would be embedded in the system in the form of refresher videos for instruction Overlays of information during repair operations can help guide the crewmember and provide procedures Figure 5 Augmented Reality Concept Mockup 


11 directly through displays or audio output replacing paper methods Most procedures have been migrated to electronic displays for ISS already The picture in Figure 5 is a photo mockup showing flight engineer Vladimir N Dezhurov using a virtual reality HMD aboard the International Space Station Note the presence of copious amounts of paper procedures posted throughout the spacecraft and the large amount of wiring floating in the air waiting to ensnare hapless crewmembers Since radio communication with the ground will be subject to long delays about 40 minute light-speed round trip transit time all the information necessary for problem solving has to be on board the spacecraft Advanced search techniques will allow the crew to find the relevant documentation for any problem or sub-system in the spacecraft The crewmember will be able to request information using spoken commands and flexible dialogue The intelligent agent systems would be designed to try to diagnose problems and provide possible remedies because the spacecraft systems may be too complicated for crewmembers to understand in detail Of course there will always be unforeseen problems which will require human reasoning and diagnosis which can be improved by the proper presentation of relevant information Virtual User Interface Design The dramatic reorganization of crewed spacecraft made possible by the new computing and communication hardware and user-interface technologies requires appropriate design Specific analyses need to be conducted to validate the savings and document the effect on the panoply of new risks and issues raised by adoption of virtual interfaces based on body worn sensors and displays It is important to note that similar claims have been made about the underlying technology for decades first when such body referenced computer displays were conceived in the 1960\325s and later when the aerospace applications were more specifically detailed in the mid 1980\325s At those time the body position tracking systems visual displays systems interactive 3D computer rendering and kinematic and dynamic computer simulations were not even approaching performance levels that would be practical  8  These technical barriers have largely been broken and the principle remaining issues concern concepts of operations and system engineering 9  The virtualization of the user interface for cockpits and control centers raises a number of significant design issues because the very nature of such interfaces removes many of the sensory cues associated with conventional user-computer interaction like the sound and feel of fingers hitting a keyboard and the kinesthetic position cues associated with mouse use These ancillary cues are important for establishing control contexts and are very important to keep users aware of 322where\323 they are in their task or software operation Fortunately the same display techniques that interfere with crew awareness can be used to enhance it by introducing naturalistic sensory feedback for inputs to virtual controls For example a switch closure on a visually presented virtual control panel can be confirmed by an auditory click as well as a visual change in color If necessary miniaturized tactile displays built into clothing or gloves can also be used to add haptic feedback The disseminated user-interface design should be guided by some of the rules for such systems proposed by Don Norman 1 0  1  Be predictable 2  Keep things as simple as possible 3  Provide good conceptual models 4  Provide rich complex and natural signals 5  Make the output understandable provide reasons for actions 6  Provide continual awareness reassurance of intended operation without annoyance 7  Exploit natural mappings of user input to environmental effects mappings The first two rules incorporate a realization that unnecessary complexity in an interface is definitely a defect Therefore the system\325s expectation of user expertise needs to be indicated to the user to avoid affecting predictability The remaining admonitions all relate to providing good conceptual cognitive models for system navigation These support the predictability of the system since one of the features of a 322good\323 conceptual model is that it leads to accurate expectations of system behavior These accurate expectations are supported by the provision of rich complex, natural feedback recommendation four This kind of feedback supports the understandability of the interface recommendation five The last recommendation to use natural mapping refers to metaphorical relationships between patterns of user inputs and systems responses and other analogous relationships in the real world When we wish to modify something on our right we typically move our hands towards our right The guidelines outlined above must be made more concrete for specific designs but their consideration will generally improve virtual user interfaces 5. I NTELLIGENT A GENTS A complementary concept to mobile virtual HSI for spacecraft command and control is the use of 322intelligent agents\323 to act as avatars for human interaction actors for autonomous operations and as experts for knowledge management The large amount of computing provided by MAA aboard a spacecraft can be comparable to an Enterprise IT system On a long duration mission to the moon or Mars this capability may significantly improve the abilities of the limited crew complement to perform vehicle and mission operations activities and can lead the way to more autonomous, capable and reliable human spacecraft 


12 Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction NASA Ames Research Center has developed prototypes for intelligent agents applied to mixed human-robotic teams and to planetary habitats  1 1  These software systems were supported by facile mobile information systems and simulations of planetary surface surveys were conducted in analog environments  1 2  The intelligent agents implemented in the Belief-Desire-Intent language Brahms responded to questions like 322Where am I?\323 322What is the current activity What is the voltage from the generator?\323 and other queries of information available in the distributed IT system The agents would also initiate commands to the robots 322Robot take a picture of me\323 322Robot go to location 1 GPS coordinates 311\323 etc Note how useful these types of human to agent interactions could be aboard a spacecraft and how they mimic natural interactions between people Figure 6 shows a picture of an astronaut performing payload operations using interactive spoken dialogue interaction with a human on Earth However aboard a future transit vehicle this may well be an intelligent agent particularly when light speed delays prevent real-time communication with Earth Intelligent agents will be in effect the extra crew members needed to run and maintain the spacecraft A crew of 3-5 persons may not be able to operate a complicated spacecraft without the support of virtual crew members capable of working 24/7 Many functions can be handled or augmented by these virtual assistants Spacecraft monitoring maintenance and repair operations are obvious candidates given the amount of work required on these tasks Activities requiring specialized knowledge could be facilitated such as medical treatment by giving the human crewmember help in executing procedures for diagnosis and treatment The following are brief summaries of selected agent functions proposed for particular activities Repair Agent Intelligent agents can monitor subsystems and follow trends in operating parameters which might signal impending problems and schedule maintenance before the system fails or loses significant function or performance The following subsystems will need to be monitored continuously 1 life support 2 navigation 3 propulsion 4 communication 5 consumables 6 power 7 radiation shielding and 8 structural integrity Most repairs have complicated diagnostic and replacement procedures to be followed along with needed diagrams and technical information The spoken dialogue system can read out the procedure steps one by one and provide the necessary diagrams and pictures All of this material needs to be on the spacecraft so that no interaction with the ground is necessary to proceed with the repair A set of intelligent repair agents can significantly reduce the time to diagnose and complete a repair while improving the quality of the repair Medical Agent The crew is a vital part of the spacecraft and their health is as important to the success of the mission as the health of the vehicle The health of the crew will be monitored continuously both during exercise and normal activities This monitoring will have to be unobtrusive because of the long duration of the mission and this requirement is nicely met using body-worn sensors Sensor-bearing vests or shirts have been suggested as ways of measuring heart rate body temperature EKG and arterial oxygen These could be integrated with the sensors used to monitor location and body position for virtual HSI These sensors provide information wirelessly to the spacecraft medical intelligent agent The agents would keep track of all of the crew physiological data and analyze it for signs of medical problems in each crew member before they became serious Often trends in medical data are very valuable for finding conditions that may become serious in the future During medical emergencies like injuries or breathing difficulties the medical agent would interact with the care giving crew member to assist in diagnosis and treatment Much work has been done in the past to develop diagnostic decision trees which allow the system and caregiver to make a rapid diagnosis Since the medical agent would already have many of the vital signs it could quickly eliminate diagnosis sub trees that do not match the measured symptoms The agent could also communicate with earthbased flight surgeons for consultation saving time during serious medical conditions Crew Personal Agent Each crew member would have an intelligent agent to keep track of schedules exercise entertainment and correspondence with the earth On the long trip to Mars it will be necessary to keep up a rigorous exercise program Since the whole crew will be dependent on a limited number of exercise machines it will be necessary to schedule these machines between the whole crew The agent system will dynamically allocate exercise times and update the schedule in case of breakdowns and other delays Scheduling and coordination can be optimized and the results of this optimization sent to the Crew Personal Agent for execution by guiding the crewmember through 


13 scheduled activities This same concept can be applied to any constrained resources Communication with the ground will be delayed for up to 40 minutes so a system which keeps track of crew questions and answers received from Mission Control will be very important When the answer to a question arrives 2 days after the initial query it will necessary to pair the query and answer automatically to save crew time and jog their memory These communications will be in speech and text/picture form and will have to be indexed and tracked 6. T ECHNOLOGY D EVELOPMENT Implementing the MAA and associated HSI concepts will require investments in improving computer technology both hardware and software Fortunately very little needs to be invented since most components have either commercial or developmental predecessors Significant development of radiation-hardened avionics computing nodes would be needed Power consumption would have to be dramatically reduced Intelligent sensor modules would need to be developed all minimizing installed cost Sensor modules would need to be very small incorporating multiple sensing elements processor and network interface The MAA relies on high-performance computing and networks which can function at many times the rate needed for control This large excess of performance is used for implementing the voting and coherency algorithms needed for effective coordination Fortunately modern semiconductor technology provides the means to implement all of these features In addition to further development of low-power radiation tolerant electronics significant advances in avionics packaging would be required For example such avionics modules could not be liquid or conduction cooled rather thermal control would have to be passive Given the fact that no wired interfaces penetrate from the exterior the use of completely sealed packages would be possible which can increase reliability and interchangeability Network technology has progressed significantly with the adoption of AFDX time-deterministic Ethernet for critical aerospace control applications  1 3  This is being used in the latest Airbus and Boeing passenger aircraft Timetriggered Ethernet is a similar alternative Each method relies on issuing packets on a timed basis with sufficient gaps in between packets to allow other time-critical packets to be interleaved which produces bounded latency  1 4  Wireless network technology has similarly progressed but to date wireless time-deterministic networks have not been developed. Mesh routing software would be needed Today several products are available that perform mesh routing at either the MAC Zigbee or TCP/IP level Tropos Mobile IP routing has been flown aboard satellites in flight tests The biggest hurdle for implementation and biggest risk is the development of the necessary system management algorithms and software architectures needed for massively redundant peer-to-peer avionics systems Although much of the critical control for MAA can be adapted from IMA the larger number of possible redundancy solutions means that better means of maintaining coherency and failover would be needed Model-based system management and diagnostics could be useful in this area The system is reconfigured according to multiple constraints synthesized from current system state Planning algorithms could be used to determine the optimal process for reconfiguring such complex redundant systems Power transmission using inductive coupling is simply a matter of producing the correct magnetic interfaces Semiconductor technology providing the high-frequency driving current is used in every switching power supply 320 not an issue for technology development However providing an alternative power source maybe more difficult in that radiative schemes for power transmission may be difficult to apply internal to a spacecraft for humans Tripleredundant power distribution schemes are possible where each module couples with more than one distribution circuit Again low power electronics enables battery backup devices to be small and lowers the performance needed from wireless power transmission methods There are a number of building block technologies needed for the virtual disseminated interfaces we are proposing The various sensory display devices that physically present the information to the users are a real challenge These are devices such as miniature flat panel displays and audio interfaces for head mounted systems Recent advances in head mounted display technology benefiting from new OLED displays and redundant optical tracking systems make possible development of virtual cockpits based on body and head mounted displays that can present cockpit virtual images laid out within a user\325s 4   steradian field of regard Such displays can replace the much heavier powerhungry flat panel displays of conventional control consoles with bright high-resolution full color lightweight displays that only draw on the order of a few watts Other types of sensors such as miniature medical sensors currently exist and can be adapted to this use Array microphones can focus upon the speech of a crew member in a given known location The corresponding audio output function can be implemented using surround sound techniques commonly used for home theater Haptic sensors for interpreting motion and gestures are now available, but the feedback elements are lagging. Other types of user input devices are emerging and may be useful The main challenge for HSI is not the device development but rather the information and sensor fusion required for providing a coherent yet dynamic and flexible user interface The interface and display-rendering software that translates all the vehicle sensor and state readings into human sensory information and then encodes human voice and action responses into commands the spacecraft can use 


14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
