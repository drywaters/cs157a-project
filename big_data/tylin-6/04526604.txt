its useful life It is the cornerstone of Prognostics Health Management PHM major goals of which are efficient maintenance and logistical practices and optimized mission or equipment use and effectiveness PHM will be achieved through monitoring a range of equipment sub-systems and combining the information to predict how and when the equipment will fail with sufficient time for action or planning This paper describes ongoing research by the University of Southampton and GE Aviation to 
investigate the intelligent processing of mechanical component health data to improve prognostics and diagnostics In particular to evaluate the effectiveness of various sensing technologies when applied to monitoring bearings extending the window of time over which a failing component condition may be determined prognosing and identifying the nature of the failure diagnosing 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS  2 3 BEARING RIG TESTS 2

toolset incorporates various Artificial Intelligence Al based technologies which have been developed for analyzing aircraft health data The toolset has two core tools data mining incorporating advanced learning algorithms and reasoning probabilistic networks and provides capabilities including data mining anomaly detection information fusion reasoning and decision support  action planning for a variety of applications see 1 and 2 for example In the work described herein the ProDAPS toolset is used 
to model the density of the data Additional techniques including Hotelling s T-squared statistic extreme value statistic EVT log-likelihood score and Entropy Score are then applied to the model to extract prognostic and diagnostic information The analysis uses data collected from a series of bearing rig tests conducted by the University of Southampton UK The test rig instrumentation included vibration and electrostatic sensors as well as off-line processes such as debris analysis 
and tribological assessment of bearing condition which may be used for corroborative purposes The various processed parameters from the electrostatic and vibration sensors are used as the input for the intelligent data analysis Two data sets are used no fault baseline data and data from an accelerated bearing failure seeded fault test The no fault data is used for training and the methodology developed is applied to the seeded fault data The paper describes the approach 
taken and techniques applied to characterize the no fault data including how to deal with natural variation in the processed sensor parameters When applied to the accelerated bearing failure test the intelligent analysis results demonstrate how the prognostic window is significantly improved relative to the original processed parameter indication and also the relevance of each processed parameter for increasing the early indication or precursor of the failure The approach also identifies the 1 


main variables extracted features which drive the anomaly detection so as to provide diagnostic information 2 ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS Feature Extraction Real-time signals from electrostatic wear-site WSS and vibration sensors were processed into a series of features These features form the input to the Al based processing The features produced for the sensor types are given in Table 1 An overview on the electrostatic technology and processing may be found in 3 Table 1 Feature Extraction for the On-Line Sensors Feature Vibration Electrostatic WSS RMS V V 1 Rev v Cage v v Roller v Outer Race v v Inner Race v Gaussian Mixture Model GMM Often it is assumed that data may be described by a single normal Gaussian distribution However real world data may be distributed in a more complicated way Data from different time intervals might occupy their own space of normality e.g vibration level varies at different times due to a different load regime or contain unknown anomalies Clearly data with these elements will not follow a single Gaussian distribution In this case the data may be characterized by a combination of Gaussian distributions or a Gaussian Mixture Model Anomaly Detection Often data sets which are believed to be fault-free contain a degree of fault or poor integrity data If such a data set is used to develop anomaly detection then the method will generally be flawed the anomaly model being de-sensitized to anomalies inherent in the training data For the current work a Gaussian Mixture Model was used to model training data and construct the anomaly detection model The entropy statistic was calculated for each cluster within the GMM Poor integrity training data was identified from clusters with the lowest entropy scores These were removed from the original GMM and the anomaly model rebuilt from the remaining data Fault Detection Indices Hotelling's T-squared Statistic is a statistic for a multivariate test of differences between the mean values of two groups Extreme Value Theory is a branch of statistics concerning data with unusually low or high values i.e data that lies in the tails of the distribution These points are significant in many applications as they represent the extremes of normal events and a means by which novel events may be defined Log-likelihood score measures how well an established GMM fits the test data The higher the log-likelihood the better the fit Mahalanobis Distance Mahalanobis distance is used to measure the similarity between the unknown test sample and known Gaussian mixture The less the distance the closer the similarity 3 BEARING RIG TESTS The bearing rig tests discussed in this paper form part of a series of tests undertaken at the University of Southampton Details of the rig may be found in other references see 4 for example so only a brief overview is provided here The bearing rig comprises four taper roller bearings housed in a chamber as shown in Figure 1 The bearings are mounted on a shaft driven by an electric motor The outer two bearings 1 and 4 are support bearings whilst the inner bearings 2 and 3 are test bearings The two test bearings have radial load applied to accelerate their failure In addition for the failure test analyzed in this paper bearing 3 was pre-indented on the inner race The baseline test was with all non-indented bearings The bearing types were LM67010 cup and LM67048 cone which are all steel bearings The rig was run at a constant speed of 2500 rpm under ambient conditions The rig was instrumented with a number of condition monitoring sensors In the test chamber there is one vibration sensor mounted externally three electrostatic wear-site sensors WSS one each on bearings 1 and 4 and one looking at bearings 2  3 and two thermocouples monitoring the outer raceways of bearings 2 and 3 The oil re-circulation pipework included an electrostatic oilline debris sensor thermocouples to measure temperature at the inlet and outlet of the test chamber and ambient temperature Additional oil-line debris sensors included an inductive debris sensor which provided particle counts for  100 microns The testing also included a number of complimentary offline analyses Oil samples were taken during various stages of the testing and these were analysed for sub-100 micron debris content Tribological analyses of the bearing condition pre and post-test were conducted and included photographic evidence and mass loss calculations Where applicable the oil-line sensors and post-test  off-line analyses were used to help interpret the responses of the vibration and WSS sensors during the tests 2

trying to detect real faults For this reason the baseline data was trimmed and a new anomaly model generated This was used in the analysis of the seeded fault test data Failure Test The failure test lasted approximately 63 hours and resulted in the unexpected failure of one of the support bearings as opposed to the seeded fault bearing Fortunately sufficient instrumentation was in place on the rig to enable the real bearing failure to be comprehensively monitored The extracted features from the failure test show responses to the impending bearing failure from the electrostatic WSS and vibration sensors from about 54 hours Examples of these responses are shown in the RMS data from the vibration and WSS sensors in Figure 3 From this it is evident that a significant bearing failure event is in progress but even with the different extracted features it is not certain exactly which bearing component i.e inner race outer race roller or cage is the cause of the event Possibly because the failure is so significant at this point many of the features are affected and therefore no clear pattern is emerging It is noted that the start of the event is within less than 10 hours of the failure which in real terms may not be sufficient time to determine the appropriate course of action inspect diagnose determine maintenance action obtain spares etc Thus whilst detection of the impending failure is clear there are two aims behind further analysis of the data First 0.2 0.18 0.16 0.14 m Indic 0.12 Impe Failu 0.1 0.08 0.06 0.04 is to determine whether an earlier prognostic evaluation of the failure can be achieved i.e can the failure be detected in advance of the final few hours Second is to see whether there is any capability for determining what the fault actually is i.e is there any clear diagnostic information available In the field both these elements of information are important if goals such as optimized maintenance planning minimum logistic footprint and maximum equipment usage are to be achieved This is true for commercial and military applications The feature extraction results from the failure test were further analysed using the Al techniques described earlier Figure 4 shows Hotelling's T-squared statistic data which has been run through the anomaly detection model From this figure there is evidence of abnormal behaviour at the start of the test which as already observed from the baseline test is due to the bearing running in The run out to failure from about 54 hours dominates There is evidence of change in advance of 54 hours an overall increase at around 36 or so hours with significant peaks between 43 and 45 hours This is shown in more detail in Figure 5 where the initial run-in and final gross failure results have been left out The in between data set is more representative of day-to-day running and shows the challenges of detecting significant changes in bearing condition amidst the normal variability For the remainder of the data analysis presented the initial run in and final failure results have been omitted 6 5 4 32  WSS3RMS VibRMS 0 1 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time hours Figure 3 Vibration and Electrostatic WSS Sensor RMS Data from Failure Test 4 1

sensor outputs In real world applications the approach may be scaled up to produce diagnostic information at equipment sub-system level a corroborated diagnostic To put this into context ProDAPS has an advanced probabilistic reasoning engine with unique capabilities for scaling to large tasks and representing sophisticated statistical models The reasoning engine is used to provide more information about an anomalous event such as the likely cause and it can assist with difficult decisions by quantifying the cost and benefits of different actions such as maintenance Reasoning can be inferencing with a-priori knowledge or case-based by matching to previous cases with similar symptoms The reasoning engine is able to combine the strengths of data driven modelling knowledge derived from experience with a-priori knowledge This paper has explained a data driven analysis technique for detecting an abnormal event that gives warning of an impending failure and extracts the processed sensor features contributing to the anomaly The reasoning engine can use a-priori knowledge about the response of these features to different failure modes to predict the type of failure The same procedure but using different anomaly modelling and contribution scoring of input features is currently being applied to Health and Usage Monitoring System HUMS vibration data collected from helicopters operating in the North Sea To date ProDAPS has highlighted many events not seen by the conventional HUMS threshold detection analysis Models for reasoning about the anomaly outputs are currently being developed and these reasoning models will have the task of distinguishing the type of fault e.g mechanical component or instrument and the nature diagnostic of the failure e.g shaft imbalance A similar architecture is being implemented for processing electrostatic debris detection data on the GE F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter JSF aircraft efficiency maximized use of equipment reduced logistic footprint optimized maintenance decision support etc are to be realized then continued development of advanced analysis techniques such as those discussed herein are essential REFERENCES 1 Rob Callan and Brian Larder The implementation of advanced diagnostic and prognostic concepts Practical tools for effective diagnostic and prognostic health management IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky Montana 2003 ISBN 0-7803-7652-8 2 Rob Callan Brian Larder and John Sandiford An Integrated Approach to the Development of an Intelligent Prognostic Health Management System IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky Montana 2006 ISBN 0-7803-9546-8 3 H E G Powrie R J K Wood T J Harvey L Wang and S Morris Electrostatic charge generation associated with machinery component degradation IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky Montana 2002 ISBN 0-7803-7232-8 4 T J Harvey R J K Wood and H E G Powrie Electrostatic wear monitoring of rolling element bearings Wear Volume 263 Issues 7-12 10 September 2007 Pages 1492-1501 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS CONCLUSIONS The results presented in this paper have shown that Al based analysis techniques have sensor data with and without the additional analysis is clearly highlighted The diagnostic results presented relate to sub-components of the bearing It is recognized that this level of diagnostic would generally be too detailed for most fielded applications the purpose of the current approach is to show that as improved 8 The authors would like to thank all those involved in setting up and running the bearing rig tests which provided the data for the current analysis and also those involved in developing the ProDAPS toolset that has been used to analyse the data BIOGRAPHY Rob Callan is a technical fellow at GE Aviation Information Systems He holds a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and a PhD in Artificial Intelligence Rob has over 20 years experience in Al with 11 of these spent in aerospace applications During the past 8 years he has been technical lead for the development and application of Al techniques for PHM The techniques concern the extraction of information from data and span the PHM functional layers from state detection to decision support Capabilities are state-of-art in the areas of anomaly detection reasoning  fusion and decision support These techniques are now being applied to helicopter health management and military engine diagnostics  prognostics Rob has published many academic papers and two textbooks on Al can be achieved from different as appropriate This paper has presented work in progress however it is evident that if operational goals such a significant role to play in optimization of equipment management Traditional feature extraction data from vibration and electrostatic sensors have been exploited to provide prognostic i.e increased time from detection to failure and diagnostic information i.e determine the nature and possibly severity of the impending failure The difference in the performance of the

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
