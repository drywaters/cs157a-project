Characterization of IP Flows Eligible for Lambda-Connections in Optical Networks Tiago Fioreze Mattijs Oude Wolbers Remco van de Meent Aiko Pras University of Twente Faculty of Electrical Engineering Mathematics and Computer Science EEMCS Department of Design and Analysis of Communication Systems DACS Enschede The Netherlands Email  t.ìoreze m.oudewolbers r.vandemeent a.pras  utwente.nl Abstract The advance on data transmission in optical networks has allowed data forwarding decisions to be taken at multiple levels in the protocol stack e.g at network and optical 
levels With such capability big IP ows can be moved from the network level and switched completely at the optical level over lambda-connections where they get better Quality of Service QoS Meanwhile the regular IP routing level is ofîoaded and can serve smaller ows better With the continuous growing of trafìc on the Internet the selection of big IP ows can become difìcult to be done by using current management approaches conventional management and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching GMPLS signaling The University of Twente UT is researching the use of self-management as an alternative to overcome this issue In order to properly identify IP ows eligible 
to be moved to the optical level the characteristics of these ows must be known though In this context this paper analyses some of the characteristics of IP ows eligible to the optical level by observing their size duration throughput and recurrence In this analysis we observe those characteristics while using various deìnitions for an IP ow as well as using different time intervals The main contribution of this paper is to show the behavior of IP ows eligible for lambda-connections Not in the least we also show how this knowledge can be used in our self-management of optical networks approach I I 
NTRODUCTION Advanced optical networks are able to make data forwarding decisions at multiple levels e.g at network and optical levels via multi-service optical switches Such ability enables for instance data packets to be fully transported at optical level lambda switching which bypasses the routing infrastructure network level resulting in a faster delivery of those packets Moreover in conjunction with multiplexing technologies such as Wavelength Division Multiplexing WDM lambdaswitching enables a lambda-connection to act like a virtual circuit Currently a number of network operators are moving towards lambda-switching enabled networks Amongst others 
G  EANT Internet2 4 Clara 5 SURFnet 6 Canarie  and HEAnet 8 Collaboration among se v eral of these operators aims at providing optical interconnect capabilities resulting in an interconnection of their research and education networks By promoting this move towards lambda-switching network operators offer new perspectives for services in optical networks Nowadays IP trafìc from several specialized applications which require huge amounts of bandwidth already proìt from lambda-switched networks capabilities Examples are Grid applications High-Deìnition T ele vision HDTV  broadcasting and the LOF AR project 11 which aims at building an interferometric array of radio telescopes mostly 
distributed over The Netherlands and Germany to allow astronomers to observe objects in space The knowledge of the heavy-hitter 1 behavior 14 15  12 of o ws originated from these applications allo ws network managers to establish lambda-connections in advance for such ows However there may be also other big IP ows in current networks that could also beneìt from being moved to lambda-connections but for some reason e.g the network manager may not be aware of their existence they may not be selected As a consequence these IP ows may not proìt from less delay and jitter as well as plenty of bandwidth found 
at the optical level In order to overcome this issue the University of Twente is investigating the use of self-management in optical networks  18 By self-management we mean the ability of multiservice optical switches to automatically 1 identify which IP ows should be moved to underlying lambda-connections and 2 establish and release the required lambda-connections for these ows In order to automatically identify which ows should be moved to the optical level the optical switches must observe IP ows by considering a set of parameters such as ow volume and duration In this context this paper focuses on the analysis of the behavior of IP ows eligible to be ofîoaded to 
the optical level by characterizing them regarding their size duration throughput and recurrence In addition we observe those characteristics while using various deìnitions for an IP ow which is a subject to be discussed in Subsection V-C as well as using different time intervals 1 According to Mori et al  hea vy-hitter o ws are o ws with a v ery large number of packets which is the same deìnition used in this paper 978-1-4244-2066-7/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 256 


Our analysis can be better divided in the following research questions 1 What are the most suitable deìnitions for ows eligible to be moved to the optical level 2 What are the characteristics of those ows regarding their size duration and throughput 3 Do those ows recur If so how often In order to answer these questions the approach outlined below will be used 1 Study of the literature in order to nd out various approaches to characterize ows 2 Collect measurements from SURFnet6 the Dutch research network In order to determine possible periodicity of eligible ows theses traces consider two weeks of collecting period 3 Deìne a criterion that existing ows must satisfy in order to make them eligible to be moved to the opticallevel We will derive this criterion by discussing the characteristics of lambda-switched enabled networks Subsection III 4 Analysis of the collected traces in order to answer the research questions The remainder of this paper is structured as follows Section II presents the study of the literature with respect to the characteristics of IP ows Section III shows a general review of the characteristics of lambda-switched enabled networks Following that our research work on self-management of optical networks is introduced in Section IV Subsequently Section V shows in more details about the collect and analysis of network traces from SURFnet6 Finally Section VI presents the results of our analysis which allows us to give the answers for our research questions in the concluding Section VII II R ELATED WORK The characterization of big IP ows in large scale optical networks has also been addressed in other research works  15 16 12 From this related w ork we highlight the following two investigations due to some similarities to this paper Papagiannaki et al  focus on the analysis of the v olume size of big IP ows as well as on their historical behavior The authors argue that the ow volume may be very volatile which results in different load values captured at different time intervals Similarly to our investigation presented in this paper the aforementioned authors performed a signiìcant variation in the time intervals 1 5 and 30 minutes and they concluded that the perceived load is the same independent of the time interval used We also proved that in a previous work In spite of the signiìcant variation in the time intervals Papagiannaki et al only used a single deìnition for a ow based on the network preìxes exported by Border Gateway Protocol BGP routers In another related work more similar to ours Lan et al  characterized big o ws by observing their size duration throughput rate and burstiness as well as by examining their correlation Although a considerable amount of ow characteristics were observed and correlated the authors did not use various deìnitions for an IP ow considering only the traditional 5-tuple ow deìnition 2  In a previous work of ours we concluded that there is no substantial variation in the deìnition of a ow in most of the investigated related works As a result of that we decided to perform our analysis by considering various deìnitions for a ow In that analysis we characterized IP o ws eligible to the optical level only with respect to their size while observing the inîuence of using different deìnitions for a ow In addition we collected only 1 day of network traces divided in 30 minutes intervals In a more recent work we e xtended our pre vious investigation by observing the percentage of IP traf c and the amount of IP ows moved to the optical level At the same time we used the same variation in the deìnition of a ow presented in our previous work b ut in contrast we collected 2 weeks of traces divided in different time intervals 5 and 30 minutes In the present paper we make use of the same collected data divided in the same time intervals 5 and 30 minutes as well as the same variation in the deìnition of a ow However we focus on the characteristics of ows eligible for lambdaconnections by observing their size duration throughput and recurrence III O VERVIEW OF LAMBDA SWITCHED ENABLED NETWORKS Lambda-switched enabled networks use lambda switching 3 technology to transfer huge amounts of data via lambdaconnections One example of a lambda-switched network is SURFnet6 which is a h ybrid optical and pack et switching research network developed within the GigaPort-RoN project 23 Although the ability to redirect speciìc wavelengths is a technological advance lambda switching similarly works as traditional routing and switching Optical switches take in a single wavelength of light from a speciìc ber optic strand and recombine it into another strand that is set on a different path Lambda switching relies in multiplexing techniques such as Wavelength Division Multiplexing WDM and T ime Division Multiplexing TDM The WDM technique consists of modulating each wavelength onto a different part of the light spectrum of a single ber The amount of multiplexed wavelengths onto a single ber can divide WDM into Coarse WDM CWDM for bers carrying less than 8 wavelengths and Dense WDM DWDM for those bers carrying from 9 up to 160 wavelengths On its turn the TDM technique 2 5-tuple ow deìnition group packets with same source and destination IP addresses same transport protocol and same transport protocol source and destination port numbers 3 Lambda switching gets its name from   the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet which has been adopted in networking to refer to an individual optical wavelength 257 


consists of dividing a wavelength in time slots in order to send data frames This approach is a basis for the todayês standards used in digital communication Synchronous Optical Networking SONET and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH SONET which is standardized by the American National Standards Institute ANSI is a set of standards for synchronous data transmission over ber optic networks that are often used for framing and synchronization at the physical layer SONET is based on transmission at speeds of multiples of 51.840 Mbps SDH is the international version of the standard published by the International Telecommunications Union ITU Transmission rates of up to 10 Gbit/s can be achieved in todayês SONET systems and the 40 Gbit/s systems are possible Table I  Optical Payload Overhead Total

of just under 10 Gbit/s Speeds beyond 10 Gbit/s are technically viable and are under evaluation Where ber exhaust is a concern multiple SONET signals can be transported over multiple wavelengths over a single ber by means of Dense Wave Division Multiplexing DWDM Such circuits are the basis for all modern transatlantic cable systems and other long-haul circuits IV S ELF MANAGEMENT OF LAMBDA SWITCHED ENABLED NETWORKS Two approaches are currently used for the management of lambda-connections in lambda-switched enabled networks  con v entional management and GMPLS signaling The former is characterized by a centralized management entity e.g human manager or an automated management process that is in charge of establishing lambda-connections and deciding which IP ows should be moved to the optical level In contrast the latter is characterized by the fact that optical switches coordinate the creation of lambda-connections among themselves after being requested to do that The decision which IP ows should be moved to the optical level however is taken by a centralized entity or by the entities exchanging data ows Both approaches however have an important shortcoming they require human interaction to detect ows and manage lambda-connections This interaction may be slow and errorprone Currently when a lambda-connection is requested within one single domain intra-domain several steps are taken e.g phone calls and emails exchanges between requesters and network domain administrators in order to establish the lambda-connections Hence it may take hours before a desired lambda-connection can be used When requests for a connection span multiple domains inter-domain the lambda-connection provisioning may take even much longer In addition to that several big IP ows eligible for lambdaconnections may somehow be transiting undetected by the managerês eyes contributing therefore to the congestion of current IP networks Our solution to overcome these shortcomings consists of providing self-management capabilities to multi-service optical switches Our self-management solution allows optical switches to be in charge of automatically selecting IP ows to the optical-level as well as creating/releasing lambdaconnections for them Network managers would only be required to conìgure the optical switches in order to deìne parameters for 1 selecting IP ows to be ofîoaded onto lambda-connection and 2 establishing and releasing lambdaconnections for those ows Once conìgured the optical switches cooperatively work by themselves It is worth to mention that the knowledge about the behavior of IP ows eligible for the optical level is important in this conìguration process Figure 1 depicts how our self-management solution looks like IP domain A IP domain C

lambda-connection in optical networks In Figure 1 IP and optical domains coordinate with one another in order to detect IP ows and manage lambdaconnections Both domains are assumed as already been conìgured by network managers IP routers located at IP domain B are exchanging information e.g ow throughput regarding the existence of a big IP ow transiting between IP domains A and C step 1 Based on this exchanged information and on the conìguration performed by network managers the IP and optical domains make decisions on whether a ow is eligible for a dedicated lambda-connection If the decision is in favor of creating a lambda-connection i.e the IP ow is eligible to be moved to the optical-level the IP routers signal the optical switches in lambda domain A step 2 Then the optical switches coordinate among themselves to create a dedicated lambda-connection to the detected IP ow step 3 From that point on the IP ow is completely switched via a lambda258

The higher granular a ow deìnition is the more details a ow deìnition has regarding the IP packets grouped into ows In addition the higher the level of granularity is the more restrictive the ow deìnition will be when grouping IP packets Our ow deìnitions go from a high level of granularity to a low level of granularity Moreover ows were deìned in this work by using the NetFlow elds listed in Table II The ow deìnitions consider different end-points and have the following descending order of granularity 1 App2App  the 5-tuple ow deìnition 2 HstHst  group of packets with the same source and destination IP addresses 3 Sub2Sub 24  group of packets matching the 24 most signiìcant bits of the source and destination IP addresses 4 Sub2Sub 16  group of packets matching the 16 most signiìcant bits of the source and destination IP addresses 5 Sub2Sub NetFlow  group of packets matching the most signiìcant bits of the source and destination IP addresses reported by BGP-enabled routers 6 AS2AS  group of packets with the same source and destination autonomous systems 7 Sub2Sub 8  group of packets matching the 8 most signiìcant bits of the source and destination IP addresses Given the abovementioned deìnitions for a ow we deìne an evaluation criterion to check whether a certain IP ow is eligible to be moved to the optical level viz Criterion an IP ow is eligible to be moved to the optical level if its bandwidth is equal or bigger than the minimal unit of transmission in SONET networks in a certain time interval average throughput  50.112 Mbit/s Variants were also deìned for this criterion by varying the time interval 5 and 30 minutes The variation in the time interval was used to check if the accuracy of the ow characteristics changes when different time intervals are used With such time intervals the threshold values for a ow to be considered eligible for a lambda-connection are 1.8 and 11 GBytes for 5 and 30 minutes intervals respectively The following ow characteristics were observed  size  the amount of bytes of a ow during the collecting period  duration  the lifetime of a ow during the collecting period  throughput  the average bandwidth consumed by a ow during its duration and  recurrence  The periodicity of a ow during the collecting period Considered ow recurrence periods every 6hs 12hs 24hs 48hs and 168hs VI R ESULTS This section presents the results of our analysis The results shown in this section only consider ows that satisìed our evaluation criterion stated in subsection V-C In addition we also used a conìdence interval of 95 to calculate the conìdence limits of our mean values A Average ow size Figure 4 shows the average size of ows using the various ow deìnitions at different time intervals     Average size 18,39 127,03 209,93 320,04 356,75 476,79 747,97 145,06 822,44 1443,70 1396,14 1625,79 1585,57 1766,44 0,00 500,00 1000,00 1500,00 2000,00 2500,00 3000,00 App2App Hst2Hst Sub2Sub 24 Sub2Sub 16 Sub2Sub NetFlow AS2AS Sub2Sub /8 GBytes 5 minutes 30 minutes Fig 4 Average ow size with 5 and 30 minutes time interval The average ow size with 30 minutes interval is higher than the average ow size with 5 minutes interval as clearly our evaluation criterion with 30 minutes interval is more restrictive and selects only ows that are big in size Note that there is a rather large variability in the ows size when using 30 minutes interval For example we saw huge ows such as 24 TB but also smaller ows such as 12 GB in Sub2Sub 8 ows Five of our deìnitions for a ow present a big average ow size Three of them Sub2Sub 24  Sub2Sub 16  and Sub2Sub 8  can be considered relevant in theory but the other two Sub2Sub NetFlow and AS2AS  can be used in practice B Average ow duration When the total period of collected data 2 weeks is divided in 30 minutes intervals the estimated duration of ows tends to be longer than their real duration Figure 5 Average duration 0,55 3,57 4,89 7,70 8,66 11,42 16,13 3,20 24,48 35,19 34,86 40,89 38,76 38,15 0,00 10,00 20,00 30,00 40,00 50,00 60,00 70,00 App2App Hst2Hst Sub2Sub 24 Sub2Sub 16 Sub2Sub NetFlow AS2AS Sub2Sub /8 Hours 5 minutes 30 minutes Fig 5 Average ow duration with 5 and 30 minutes time interval 260 


In this case the use of smaller time intervals such as 5 minutes reports more precise estimation about the real duration of a ow This can be seen in Figure 5 where the estimation regarding the duration of a ow is much bigger when 30 minutes intervals are used There is also large variability in the ows duration when using 30 minutes interval Regarding the comparison between the duration versus different deìnitions for a ow ow deìnitions with lower level of granularity e.g Sub2Sub NetFlow and AS2AS  tend to aggregate more IP packets into longer continuous periods of time C Average ow throughput The average ow throughput appears reasonable constant independently of the ow deìnition used Figure 6 However when longer time intervals are used the average throughput tends to be bigger as well That happens because only big ows are selected In contrast when smaller time intervals are used not only the big ows are selected but also many small ones which decreases the average throughput     Average throughput 71,68 67,47 68,68 70,36 70,69 72,39 74,07 86,83 78,55 84,15 81,09 87,17 80,79 79,17 0,00 20,00 40,00 60,00 80,00 100,00 120,00 140,00 App2App Hst2Hst Sub2Sub 24 Sub2Sub 16 Sub2Sub NetFlow AS2AS Sub2Sub /8 Mbit/s 5 minutes 30 minutes Fig 6 Average ow throughput with 5 and 30 minutes time interval D Flow recurrence percentage The greatest recurrence percentage found in our analyses was a daily recurrence Figure 7   Percentage of IP flows with daily recurrence 1 8 6 6 3 16 7 0 15 14 13 10 24 16 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 App2App Hst2Hst Sub2Sub /24 Sub2Sub /16 Sub2Sub NetFlow AS2AS Sub2Sub /8 5 minutes 30 minutes Fig 7 Daily recurrence with 5 and 30 minutes time interval The other recurrence periods considered in our analyses showed results smaller than 2 and were purposely omitted in this section due to space constraints The use of 5 minutes interval selects several ows that have a burst behavior and are sporadic in time i.e they occur at irregular period of time On the other hand the 30 minutes interval selects ows that are longer in time and occur regularly e.g backup trafìc As a consequence of that the percentage of ows with a daily recurrence is bigger when long time intervals are used e.g 30 minutes interval In addition to that the use of different deìnitions for a ow has certain inîuence over the recurrence due to the time aggregation Flows that occur in different time intervals may overlap when less granular ow deìnitions are used As a result ows that may be sparse in time e.g App2App  can be grouped into regular occurrence intervals and therefore present a higher percentage of recurrence e.g AS2AS  VII C ONCLUSION This paper presented the characteristics of IP ows eligible to the optical level while using various different deìnitions for a ow The characteristics observed were size duration throughput and recurrence In addition different time intervals were used in order to study whether they have any impact on the eligibility i.e ow characteristics of moving ows to the optical level Based on the analysis performed and in the results obtained we can now answer our research questions 1 What are the most suitable deìnitions for ows eligible to be moved to the optical level In order to ofîoad IP ows that consume considerable amount of resources at the network level onto lambdaconnections and at the same time maximize the use of the high capacity transmission offered by the optical level we look for deìnitions of a ow that are big in size Subsection VI-A and long in duration Subsection VI-B Based on that Sub2Sub NetFlow and AS2AS are the best candidates for ow deìnition in practice On the other hand in theory the Sub2Sub 8 is the best option However in practice this ow deìnition is not feasible as it groups ows coming from non-adjacent networks 2 What are the characteristics of those ows regarding their size duration and throughput The characteristics of ows eligible to be moved to the optical level mostly depend on the ow deìnition used as well as on the restrictiveness of our criterion Subsection V-C The average size and duration of a ow increases when longer time intervals and lower granular ow deìnitions are used In the case of the ow throughput Subsection VI-C its average is constant independent of the ow deìnition used but it varies if different time intervals are used due to the size of the selected ows In average the size of ows eligible to be moved to the optical level varies from small sizes 18 GB to big sizes 1.7 TB The ow duration can be a couple of hours but also several 261 


days Regarding throughput it stays between 60 and 100 Mbit/s 3 Do those ows recur If so how often Flows eligible to the optical level present predominantly a daily basis recurrence as showed in our analyses Subsection VI-D We also found some other ow recurrences e.g weekly backups within SURFNet6 but they reoccurred less than 2 of the considered analysis period 2 weeks Within the daily basis recurrence the use of long time intervals inîuences in the selection of ows that last for long periods and have a regular behavior pattern On the other hand small time intervals select several ows with a burst behavior whose occur in non-regular periods of time This allows concluding that restrictive ow deìnitions e.g App2App  show lesser recurrence percentage than non-restrictive ones e.g AS2AS  The main contribution of this work was to show the characteristics of the ows eligible for lambda-connections The knowledge of such characteristics is particularly important to our research work regarding to the self-management of lambda-connections in optical networks By providing quantiìcation of the observed characteristics to the multi-service optical switches they can automatically take decisions about moving ows to the optical level For instance the optical switches can be conìgured to use a deìnition for a ow such as Sub2Sub NetFlow and AS2AS that groups more IP packets into long and big ows The use of such deìnitions can result in a better performance of both network and optical levels heavy-hitter ows could be ofîoaded from the network level to the optical level where they would get no jitter and plenty of bandwidth Meanwhile routing resources at the network level could be better used by the remaining smaller IP ows A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The research on self-management

  8 system in EOC software devel opment.  One screen is used to display the main page of the Monitor and Control System GUI, and the other screen shows the GUI query page and xterm consoles of other nodes in the EOC.  Figure 6 is an example shot of the main GUI page. In the page, either an existing experiment name or a new experiment name is selected for executing operati ons.  There are 11 tables on the page which display live messages respectively received from DINET nodes.  The message display is started by selecting the \223start/update\224 button and temporarily paused by  selecting the \223Pause\224 button.  Moreover, all messages received and stored in the database can be dumped into a text file as the \223save\224 button is selected and a file name is entered. The top and middle of the page shows the network topology which is updated dynamically as the network connectivity changes  Figure 6 \226 Monitor and Control System GUI main page Figure 7 shows an example of the GUI query page.  In order to query the messages stored in the database, an experiment name is specified along with \(optionally\essage type message source node, number of messages, message creation time, and then the \223query\224 button is clicked.  The messages stored in the data which meet the query criterion are shown on the table of the query page, and those resultant messages can also be dumped into a text file by clicking the \223save\224 button and entering a file name.  The table content and topology display on both web GUI page are locally and dynamically updated without interfering with the display of the main page by the use of Ajax and Java servlet techniques

With the results gathered from the operations cen ter software, an analysis was performed on the experime nt outcome characterizing the overall performance of DTN From a broad perspective, the experiment was a success in that it proved the ION software capable of space mission operation and raised the technology readiness level to that of a tested and flown software package.  The DTN concept proved capable of automatically re-transmitting missing or corrupt data without flight team intervention, specifically demonstrated during several small unplanned communications outages at DSN stations.  DTN management actions were requi red to update the ION clock aboard EPOXI on a semiweekly basis to compensate for a drifting spacecraft clock, as well as insert new routes after an unplanned power outage across the EOC network Experiment analysis yielded DTN performance benchmarks in link utilization, prioritizati on, node storage and routing For all passes with sufficient data in the transmission queue DINET maintained a link utilization rate over 90%, even when introducing artificial link errors by dropping approximately every 32 nd LTP segment.  Received data analysis confirmed that higher priority information maintained an advantage over lower priority information and also that this advantag e increased as link capacity diminished \(due to the artificial data loss on the link\.  The node storage utilization benc hmark provided proof that node storage usage stabilized over the course of the experiment, approaching steadystate.  An analysis of network traversal showed that data was efficiently moved through different paths as dictated by the ION routing algorithm when the network topology changed. This demonstrated the advantages of the routing automation afforded by the ION routing protocol 5  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper has briefly described the JPL Deep Impact Network \(DINET\ay/Disruption Networking \(DTN technology experiment, intended to increase the technical readiness DTN for space missions and supporting ground and space-based relay infrastruct ure.  This represents the first deep space implementation of DTN in flight and ground software, and paves the way for future space networks.  DINET demonstrated the Interplanetary Overlay Network \(ION\mplementation of DTN, which incorporates the Bundle Protocol and LTP retransmission protocol.  We have described the DINET Experiment Operations Center \(EOC its functions in accomplishing this experiment.  The DINET EOC starts all ION processes experiment data sources, stat us message receiver processes and display processes.  The ION-based Monitor and Control System is an innovative, intranet-based software application which receives status messages and displays live results from the DINET network.  With this Monitor and Control application, the ION software and protocol diagnostic messages issued by network nodes are collected, analyzed stored into a database in real-time.  This application also provides a web interface for viewing the data in real-time and for interactive database queries 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and the Nationa l Aeronautics and Space Administration

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
