Web Services Monitoring: An Initial Case Study on the Tools Perspective Aimilios Chourmouziadis Centre of Communications and Systems Research University of Surrey Guildford, United Kingdom A.chourmouziadis@surrey.ac.uk George Pavlou Centre of Communications and Systems Research University of Surrey Guildford, United Kingdom G.Pavlou@surrey.ac.uk   Abstract Web Services are an XML-based technology that has been recently viewed as capable of being used for network management. An aspect of WS-based management is monitoring Monitoring is concerned with the collection of management data 
reflecting the status of a manage d system. WS-Based monitoring has to be performed efficiently reducing machine and network resource consumption since in such systems latency, memory and traffic overhead is increased by using XML tags to describe data This is a big challenge that requires sophisticated mechanisms to retrieve data, such as bulk or selective retrieval to be employed One technology suggested to address this goal is the XML Path Language. Still XPath as a filtering tool raised a lot of concerns in the NetConf mailing list, about its scalability. Based on these concerns a parser has been developed by the authors to also 
address data retrieval in network management. This paper is an initial scalability study on these tools to identify potential problems that will need further investigation Keywords: WS, XML, XML Path, Monitoring, Event Reporting I   I NTRODUCTION  The growing use of the eXtensible Markup Language XML\ for data representation along with the development of many XML-based technologies has spurred research in many fields. One such technology is Web Services \(WS\ whose promise for application integration interoperability etc. has lead researchers to consider it for network management 
An aspect of using WS for network management is monitoring. Monitoring usually involves retrieving data from a managed system by requesting for it and receiving the response on the same channel the request was sent from \(pull synchronous invocation style For WS-based monitoring an efficient way to retrieve management data is required. This is important since management data represented in verbose XML documents and tags, increase network resource overhead of WS-based management operations.  Therefore tools to process construct or manipulate XML documents are re quired so as to be able to extract data efficiently and reduce the extra overhead 
Two of the industrys options for processing and querying XML documents are the XML Path \(XPath\ Language v. 1.0 1 a n d 2  0  2    T h o ugh t h e s e t w o to o l s we r e  no t d e ve lo p e d implicitly for network management information retrieval, they can still be used to address this domain Network management operations though, require keeping resource usage, latency and traffic overhead low.  Therefore tools that may take into account the network management goals could also be developed One such tool is a parser developed and presented by the authors in T h e pars er i s  built on Javas regular expression engine, allowing extraction 
of management data using queries to perform bulk and selective operations on WS interfaces exposing these data This paper is an initlal scalability study of the perfomance of these tools to identify potential problems needing further investigation The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In section II, some details of the tools whose latency performance we will be assessing for WS-based monitoring are going to be provided.  Section III analyzes a management information retrieval scenario of a QoS-enabled Traffic Engineered \(TE\etwork based on which these three technologies would be compared upon. Section IV explains the queries that need to be performed with each tool for the 
previous scenario. In Section V an inital comparison of these three tools in terms of latency is presented to identify potential tools problems. Finally, section VI presents our conclusions II  I NFORMATION R ETRIEVAL T OOLS  A  XPath 1.0 XPath version 1.0 [1 an d 2 0 [2  a r e W 3 C  can di dat e  recommendations in 1999 and 2005. They took their name from the path notation syntax with slashes \(/\ they use to control the selection of specific portions of an XML document As already implied, XPaths 1.0 main use is to locate elements in an XML document. A secondary use of it is to perform operations on data \(Numeric, String, Boolean 
XPath 1.0 is a subset of its successor and has limited capabilities compared to v2. XPath 1.0 is not a programming language and has to be embedded in a host language to be used Some of the shortcomings of XPath1 compared to its predecessor are: \(a\ a limited number of supported functions b\ry simple data model \(c\t taking advantage of processors data-typing capabilities and \(e\ has simple validation and error management capabilities 827 978-1-4244-2066-7/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 


The most important shortcoming of XPath1 compared to its predecessor though is expressiveness. This allows the latter to form more flexible queries and thus search an XML document to find specific nodes more effectively. Though XPaths2 functionality has increased, so has its memory requirements Due to its size and complexity, XPath 2.0 may require more long term memory than XPath1 XPath 1 and 2 though include more than enough, and even more than required, functionality to be able to address the WSbased management requirements for monitoring. Still the luck of functionality and expressiveness of XPath 1.0 on one side and the heavier memory requirements and complexity XPath 2 has on the other side may have an impact on latency, traffic and memory footprint. This paper is an initial performance study of these tools on latency, to identify potential problems that may opt us to perform further investigations B  Custom based Tool The development of a custom based tool for retrieving management data could in theory address management goals.more efficiently Since efficient retrieval for monitoring at the SOAP level is not an option as more data than required would have to be retrieved, en coded, processed or filtered and since depending heavily on XML parser for data processing may be a heavy solution for management tasks as large documents may need to be searched or loaded into memory the parser in w a s dev e l opped t o a o r k in t h e appl i cat ion  level \(b\ process raw data for selective or bulk retrieval \(c\ use an XML parser to only send response to queries in XML format over SOAP.

Currently QoS is provided on the basis of Service Level Agreements \(SLAs\hese are a set of terms that clients and service providers have to respect when using or providing a service.  The technical part of an SLA is a Service Level Specification \(SLS and it represents the means to quantify QoS services [5  I P Dif f e r e ntiated Ser v ices  4   DiffServ\ is considered as th e most prominent framework for providing QoS-based services and one of the means to support it is over Multi-Protocol Label Switching \(MPLS\ networks Monitoring of the network status and its resources is an essential process so as to ensure that a QoS networks operation will not be compromised. To guarantee the latter Traffic Engineering \(TE\ed. TE requires suitable scalable monitoring systems for the collection of various data in order to ensure the networks smooth operation. This constitutes a significant challenge in QoS-enabled networks B  Data Retrieval for QoS Management with each tool Previous examples of research in monitoring has been performed in the TEQUILA h e CA DEN U S 7], an d t h e  ENTHRONE frameworks [8  A l l th e s e  f r am ew o r k s r e ly  o n  their monitoring systems that capture their network state in order to offer QoS guarantees to their clients. The monitoring systems used for data collection in these frameworks are mostly based on the Manager-Agent paradigm In the scenario we will presen t later on, measurements at the LSP, or SLS level have to be performed. For this reason we have selected two of SNMPs MPLS MIBs to represent management data. These are the MPLS Label Switching Router \(LSR d t h e MP L S  For w ardi n g Equ i v a lence Class to Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry \(FEC-To-NHLFE  T h e f o r m er MIB is  u s ed t o perf or m PHB a n d LS P  measurements and the latter for SLS measurements Having the MPLS MIBs as the management data source WS equivalent interfaces exposing the same management data were built and deployed for all tools. Both the custom parser and XPath are designed to be used as side tools by WSs exposing management data For XPath 1.and 2 each WS allows three views to its data by maintaining them in XML documents. The views are: \(a\ a single instance data view \(b\a multiple-instance data view \(c both single and multiple instance data view. The process to retrieve data with XPath 1&2 is based on the manager-agent paradigm. The manager after selecting the appropriate method depending on the view of the data it wants to have, sends a number of XPath queries to the agent. At the agent, the WS method that is accessed by the manager extracts all the XPath queries and uses its XPath instance to analyze them and access the XML documents data it has view upon. After the required data are selected the agent sends the response to the manager in an XML document format For the custom based tool each WS allows three views to its raw data \(a\imple structures view \(b\plex structures view \(c\ all data view. The process to retrieve data with the custom based parser is similar to XPath and is also based on the manager agent paradigm. The only main difference in this case is that the custom based pa rser processes raw data.  For all three tools, bulk and selective retrieval is supported by queries that are interpreted by the instances of each tool used in each WS C  Information Retrieval Scenario In the management scenario we will be using in section V to identify potential problems that will need further investigation for each tool, we assume that the interface of a router of an MPLS network providing QoS-based services fails. When this occurs the manager is notified of this event On receiving this event the manager performs queries so as to find out the LSPs and SLSs affected by the failing interface and take appropriate actions IV  S CENARIO Q UERIES  For an entity like a manager to determine with any tool the affected LSPs and SLSs for the scenario in the previous sections three queries must be sent to the entity hosting the management information such as an agent. These queries sent from the manager to the agent supervising the router whose 828 


interface failed perform the following: \(a Determine the interface indices of the LSPs associated with the failing interface, \(b these indices to determine the affected LSPs \(c Determine the affected SLSs using the LSP IDs from step b. The relevant queries for XPath 2&1 and the parser are given in Figs 1, 2 and 3 respectively A  XPath 1.0 and 2.0 queries In XPath the most common perception that people have about an XML document is that of a tree of nodes. There are various types of nodes and they share various types of relationships More details are given in Selecting nodes in XPath is performed with a series of path expressions most common of which are given in Table 1.These expressions are used to navigate the nodes and the relationships they share.  Looking at the scenario XPath 2&1 queries in Figs 1&2 respectively, it can be seen that XPath1 queries are more verbose than their XPath2 counterparts. This occurs, because though XPath 1.0 has most mathematical and logical operators, XPat h 2 is richer in logical expressions and functions. This allows the latter to be more expressive. For example though XPath1 allows expressions such as \(a|b|c\/d/e making use of parentheses for grouping operations, it does not allow expressions such as /a/b/\(c |d | e\ath 2.0 supports parentheses usage anywhere in the path expression and allows us to perform sufficiently less filtering operations \(operator   d search t h e docum e n t  m o re eff ecti v el y  f o r m e r g i n g operations \(operator |\ in addition to less verbose queries Fig 1&2\. This may mean performance penalties for XPath1 TABLE 1 Path expression in XPath for selecting nodes  Nodename Selects all nodes after this node  Selects nodes having as start point root node  Selects nodes from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are  Selects the current node  Select the parent of the current node  Selects attributes from a node  Selects any element node   F i n d a no d e t h at con t ai n s a sp eci f i c val u e    Fig. 1 XPath 2.0 queries B  Custom based Parser The custom based parser in a s bu i l t t o su pport bu l k  and selective retrieval from WSs that expose management Fig. 2 XPath 1.0 QoS scenario queries data. Thus, the parser was built to allow the user to select the WS\(s\ to retrieve data from and also to define specific data to retrieve from each WS. This is supported by appropriate qu qu er y  h a s a special f u n c tio n a lit y  T h ere are  four types of queries each of which is use to retrieve specific data from different data structures. More details are given in 3 The fact that there are only 4 types of queries and a small number of operators supported by the parser means that the latter has less functi onality and can not be as expressive as XPath 1&2. On the other hand limiting functionality can help keep the grammar of the parser simpler, less verbose, easier to learn and keep latency consumption overhead low Examples of the custom parser queries equivalent to their XPath counterparts in Fig 1&.2 are given in Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Custom based parser queries  Comparing the queries in Figs 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the row identifiers of each SNMP table row entry are also retrieved with each query. Using the custom parser this is performed by default since the SNMP information model mandates this so as to be able to distinguish table row entries This increases latency overhead and thus it is also performed for XPath implementations to keep things for measurements on the same terms.  All querie s allow us to check the latency overhead performance of each tool for performing merging bulk retrieval\ and filtering operations of varied complexity V  E VALUATION  A  System Setup for measurements For the evaluation aspects of our scenario the MPLS LSR and FEC-to-NHLFE MIBs are exposed as WS interfaces.. The Apache Axis 1.4 SOAP toolkit is used to deploy WS interfaces using a Document/literal encoding style. For XPath 829 


1.0 functionality JAXP 1.3 is used. XPath 2.0 is supported by SAXON 8.9. Javas 1.5.6 regex engine is used for the parser Both XPath implementations come from respected bodies are very mature and fully conformant to standards. To our knowledge there are no other java based or different language based tools that meet all these requirements.  Latency measurements were performed using Javas currentTimeMillis\(\ function by averaging on 10 samples. The manager and agent were deployed on a 1000MHz/256MB RAM and 466MHz/192MB RAM machine respectively, thus simulating a lower end system for the agent. Both machines ran Red-hat Linux 7.3 B  Measurements The measurements we will analyze in this section involve traffic overhead for the QoSbased scenario presented in section III-C to identify if there can be potential scalability problems with any of the used tools which will signify whether a deeper investigation needs to be performed For assessing each tool performance for our QoS scenario the ingress router is configured to have 30 LSPs to simulate a small QoS network each of which is assigned to a different customer. The reason behind assi gning a different customer to each LSP is to keep things si mple with respect to validity checks on the data returned after a query. A further assumption in this experiment is the number of LSPs & SLSs affected by the failing interface, which is six. This seems like a plausible number for small networks although an optimal number is difficult to identify. This main reason behind this selection though is to use a plausible number of   filtering operations in each tool query to check for potential issues  Parser_Query1_30LSPs Parser_Query2_30LSPs Parser_Query3_30LSPs Parser_Total_30LSPs XPath1.0_Query2_30LSPs XPath1.0_Query1_30LSPs XPath1.0_Query3_30LSPs XPath1.0_Total_30LSPs XPath2.0_Query1_30LSPs XPath2.0_Query2_30LSPs XPath2.0_Query3_30LSPs XPath2.0_Total_30LSPs 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Measurement Type Latency \(ms  Fig. 4 Latency overhead for a small QoS network  From figure 4 it can be seen that the custom parser we have developed performs better than XPath 1&2 even for a small network where a small number of data needs to be processed. XPath 2.0 and 1.0 produce 116% and 166% times respectively more latency than the custom parser Additionally since the operations for the queries that are performed involve a varied number of filtering and merging operations \(bulk\ we  can detect that while the custom parser is relatively unaffected by this, both XPath implementations performance is affected when the number of merging and filtering operations varies. Lastly it is also evident from the queries in Figs 1 & 2 that XPath 2 expressiveness allows it to perform less filtering queries and at the same time perform merging operations better which is evident from the latency improvement on all queries compared to XPath 1 VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper we have shown that W3C mature and fully conformant to standards XPath implementations present potential scalability problems in terms of latency compared to the custom parser for accessing a small networks management data. As such we consider that there is a lot of ground to investigate on many other issues. One such issue is how these tools perform compared to an increasing data volume size. It is also worth considering finding the potential root of this scalability problem and possible solutions to alleviate it. Moreover it is necessary to check if the latency scalability problem is applicable to memory and traffic overhead as well  Furthermore acceptance, grammar simplicity and verboseness, development time and expressiveness are also things that need to be considered under the scope of such an investigation Nevertheless although this is an initial study it has shown that there are potential problems with XPath implementations when these tools are used for mo nitoring and these issues need to be investigated. We have also shown that custom implementations and in general tools built to fit management objectives may also have some application potential, since management tasks require from tools used to address management objectives, to balance between what is required to support functionality, expressiveness and performance A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research work in this paper was partly supported by the IST EU EMANICS and the IST ENTHRONE phase 2 projects  R EFERENCES  1  J.

In PE 3, muxes “s1” and “s2 Figure 4 select computation of either 8x16 or 16x8 motion ve ctors Thereafter, demuxes “s3” and “s4” direct 8x16 or 16 x8 SADs to their corresponding comparators and registers Then  16x16 SAD is computed from either 8x16 or 16x8 SADs. Now we will discuss the routing patterns for different search a lgorithms 4.4  Fast Search Algorithms and Case Study Fast search algorithms like diamond, hexagon, big h exagon and spiral have been introduced to reduce the computati on complexity of motion estimation by operating on red uced number of reference blocks Number of reference blo cks for diamond and hexagon searches are shown in figures 6  and 11 Diamond search requires 9+5n+4 reference blocks  17  a n d  hexagon search requires 7+3n+4 18  r e f e r e n c e  b l o cks where  n is the number of execution iterations Diamond Search As shown in figure 6, pattern consists of nine candidate search points reference blocks in first  iteration Numbers in this figure represent the order of proce ssing the reference frames Directed edges are labeled with d ata transmission equations derived for diamond search p attern based on the data dependencies The grid co-ordinates fol lowed for data transfer is shown in fig 9. An equation is rep resented with nx\ and \(+/-ny\ where \(+ or -\ denotes the dire ction of data transfer on the x and y axis and n denotes the numb er of hops in that direction. Also, load indicates that reference block is loaded from the main memory We now explain SAD computation using diamond search  pattern for a 16 x 16 current block on the proposed architecture Figure 5 represents the current frame which is divi ded into blocks of size 4 x 4.  Sixteen 4x4 current blocks 5 3, 54, 55, 56 65 66 67 68 77 78 79 80 89 90 91 92 are loaded into CPE  \(1,1\, CPE  \(1,2\, CPE  \(1,3\, CPE  \(1,4\, CPE 2,1\, CPE 2,2 CPE  2,3 CPE  2,4 CPE  3,1 CPE  3 2 CPE 3,3\, CPE  \(3,4\, CPE  \(4,1\, CPE  \(4,2\, CPE  \(4 3\, CPE  \(4,4 respectively Each PE1 of the CPEs with a current b lock processes SAD on 9 reference blocks. PE1 \(1,1\ comp utes SAD for current block 53 against reference blocks 29 40’, 42’, 55 53’, 51’, 64’, 66’, 77 Figure 7 shows data dependencies and data transfer patterns for PE1\(1,1 and PE1\(1,3 Solid squares represent inte rsecting search points between the two and solid circles rep resent the other search points Table 1 shows the reference bl ock to be loaded in PE1s at different clock cycles. At clock cycle one, first search points \(reference blocks P 1 1 and P 3 1 are loaded into both processing elements from main memory through MI Fo r this NIs of CPE\(1,1 and CPE\(1,3 set  respective  data_load_control  signals to high indicating the CPE ids and “reference_block_id” output  to 1 indicating th e index of the search point on the diamond pattern \(figure 7\. Bas ed on these inputs and address of the current frames MI genera tes the addresses of the reference frames as per the search  pattern and outputs it to the main memory Main memory then se nds the requested data through corresponding “CPE” input po rts. In this case first reference blocks for PE1\(1,1 and PE1\(1 3 are 29 and 31’ respectively. Figure 7 shows that third sea rch point \(P 1 3  required by PE1\(1,1 is same as second search point  P 3 2  of PE1\(1,3 At clock cycle three P 3 2 is transmitted from PE1\(1,3\’s router to PE1\(1,1 The NI of PE1\(1,3 p acketizes the reference block according to data transmission equation Figure 6 Equation 1x+1y arrow labeled from poi nt 1 to 2 and sends the packets to the router The router of PE1\(1,2 receives the packets, decodes the header packet and following xy routing scheme forwards the packets to the route r of PE1\(1,1 PE1\(1,1 is the destination node hence it s NI depacketizes the data to be processed within its PE 1 Same events take place at cycles 5, 6 and 8 as shown in Figure 8.  The events illustrated with Figure 8 take place for all  sixteen 4x4 current blocks. The above data transfer pattern als o dictates that at every clock cycle, every CPE is accessing a uniq ue reference block. So, at no time slot, two CPEs compete for th e same data and there is no case of resource conflict For every successive iteration, nine SADs are compu ted in each PE1 If the computed SAD minima is located at one o f the vertices  1,4,6 and 9 or edges 2,3,7,8  of the  diamond Figure 6\ , a new diamond pattern is formed with t he minima as the new center for the next iteration This again r equires computation of SADs for next nine reference frames in the same order as in figure 7. But in this case, minima at t he vertex leads to only 5 new reference frames and the minima at th e edges lead to only 3 new reference frames for one iteration I n the last iteration, the minima is the center point \(5\. In t hat case, a small diamond is formed around the minima with 4 referenc e frames The order of reference frames for loading the data for this case and the data transmission equations are shown in fi gure 10. Data transmission equations for hexagon big hexagon and  spiral search patterns are shown in figure 11. The spiral search is more compute-intensive compared to other fast search pat terns The width of the spiral search determines the number of  reference frames to be compared In this example we carry ou t a 5x5 spiral search as shown in figure 11\(c So the num ber of reference frames is 25 Full Search Now we illustrate the functionality of the proposed architecture for full search. Table 2 show s data load schedule  for PE1\(1,1 As shown in table 2\(a at cycle on e four pixels of 4x4 current block are loaded into CP R registers 1 2, 3, 4 through current_data_\(1,1\ port. At cycle t wo, these four pixels are shifted to CPR registers 5, 6, 7, 8 and next four pixels are loaded into CPR registers 1 2 3 4 This cont inues for 4 cycles till a 4x4 current block is completely loade d into PE 1\(1,1\ as shown in table 2\(b\. Similarly, a 4x4 ref erence block is loaded into RPR registers of PE 1\(1,1 in four cycl es through reference_data_\(1,1 port All the PE1s are loaded with corresponding current and reference blocks in a sim ilar fashion At the end of the fifth clock cycle, 4x4 SADs are c omputed and sent to PE 2\(1 Table 3 Control signals to PE 2 1 select between computation of 4x8 SAD or 8x4 SAD at the en d of sixth cycle. At the end of seventh cycle, 8x8 SAD i s computed Similarly, four 8x8 SADs are then sent to PE 3. In PE 3, control signals select between computation of 8x16 SAD or 1 6x8 SAD 


                                         at the end of eighth cycle. At the end of ninth cyc le, 16x16 SAD  is computed \(Table 4\. Now, we present the performa nce results of our architecture and compare it with the ASIC ba sed approach [9   5  RESULTS Proposed architecture was designed with Verilog-HDL  description and synthesized by 90 nm CMOS standard cell library. Design contains about 82K gates.

Rest of the computations in our architecture and [9  a r e  p i p e l i ned. Thus, [9  requires 265 cycles to produce a 16x16 motion vecto r for full search while our architecture requires 266 cycles Table 6 shows the minimum clock rate that is required to sustain 30fps and 60fps frame rates by the proposed architecture and its counterpart 9   A s  s h o w n  i n  t a b l e  6   f o r  Q C I F  f o r m at ASIC approach [9  n e e d s  t o  o p e r a t e  a t  0  7 6  M H z  t o  s u s t a i n the 30fps requirement, whereas our design needs a little fast er clock. This is because the number of cycles required to compute  16x16 motion vector is larger in our design 266 cycles  vs 9  2 6 5  cycles\.  For clock rates slower than 0.8 MHz, our design won’t be able to sustain 30fps  As shown in table 6 for  all frame sizes, our clock rate is comparable with [9   A s  e x pected, while the frame size gets larger the clock rate needs to  increase to respond to the more number of computations with the 30fps or 60 fps constraint Fewer number of search points for fast search algor ithms overcomes the “router” cycles overhead and requires even lesser number of cycles than full search Router’s critica l path consumes 6 cycles. Total data transmission cycles a re the sum of router cycles and total number of hops. Since avera ge number of hops for fast search patterns is 2, the routing cyc le’s overhead is 8 cycles per search point. Also, worst case number of reference blocks accounts from n=4 and best case comes from n 0 on a 32x32 search region. So, the best case and worst ca se number of search points are 13 and 33 for diamond search Inc luding the Table 2 \(a\ Data load schedule for PE1 Table 2 \(b\ Data load schedule for PE1 Table 3 Data flow for calculation of 8x8 SAD Table 4 Data flow for calculation of 16x16 SAD 0ÿišhù/ý8Ž» Ú×\`þÄ :3èàÍ£(èÜÞ¡k9\×•.h_ zû4Cß÷aþÍ0Ïs z ÀÀûý¾€!ÃëõŠÜB gMÓPÀ0Ãf K„PŠë#Â2À$ãn·+‹`ð²\.pŠ_.Çqz½ž Î2¨Ç*Ä€	B@Œ˜Ïçív[Ð@UU0ðB Øäd€Ó1‘VNÐ0   V«#‘Æ-Ž@G*•"ÜŽ˜ÍfX  K 82˜N§™L†-(‹&Ès¹#€'.¬çyQF£d2 VõÞ[kA’ÆÊEN    K  L€³¦iZ×5ß÷5†º®Ñ†!*žbÑ>Ã¾ï¯×+MSáôëº`€,ËŽãèºÎ¶m Figure 12.

routing overhead diamond search takes 104 cycles a nd 264 cycles for best case and worst case scenarios respe ctively which is less than 266 cycles of full search Similarly the worst case and best case number of search points are 23 and 11  for hexagonal search and thus it takes 184 and 88 cycle s respectively to produce a 16x16 motion vector. The worst case and best case number of search points are 33 and 21  for big hexagonal search and thus it takes 264 and 168 cycl es respectively to produce a 16x16 motion vector Also  the number of search points is constant for all the cas es of a spiral search For a 5x5 spiral search Figure 11\(c the  number of search points is 25 and thus it takes 200 cycles to  produce a 16x16 motion vector  Therefore architecture suppo rts fast search algorithms with operational frequencies less than the full search algorithm table 6 as shown in Table 7 For  QCIF format our architecture operates at 0.8MHz for ful l search Whereas as shown in Table 7 for DS HS BHS and S S it operates at 0.78 0.55 0.78 0.59 MHz correspondin gly for worst case scenarios. Since the number of search po ints for fast search types decrease significantly our architectu re can now operate at a slower clock rate even for the worst c ase scenarios to sustain the 30fps Further this pattern is obse rvable for all frame sizes Thus, the clock rate of the proposed architecture i s comparable to ASIC implementation for both full search and fas t search algorithms with much lesser resources. Therefore, t he frame size and frame rate supported by the circuit can be subs tantially extended subject to this clock rate constraint for high definition 6  CONCLUSION This paper proposed a new application specific reco nfigurable hybrid coarse-grained architecture with intelligent NoC scheme Existing coarse-grained architectures have generic processing elements and routing structure and therefore suffer  in performance and resource utilization for motion est imation algorithm as compared to our architecture. The inte lligent NoC scheme in our architecture supports VBSME for diffe rent types of fast search patterns like diamond search hexago nal search etc Hybrid grained processing elements support var iable block sizes in motion estimation. Simplicity and highly p arallel nature of the architecture with an excellent degree of dat a reuse makes our design suitable for run time reconfiguration A rchitecture can easily be configured to run any fast search or full search algorithm with block size variations to respond to the video quality and/or timing constraints Our 2D architect ure supports huge reuse of search data between processing elemen ts and thus reduces the memory transaction requirement which is missing in existing state of the art approaches Proposed arch itecture uses hybrid grained processing elements to compute 4x8 o r 8x4 and 8x16 or 16x8 motion vectors dynamically depending o n the control signals supplied. Our architecture is highl y flexible as it supports any block size for any search type which i s a challenging problem from ASIC perspective 7  REFERENCES 1  T. Wiegand, G. J. Sullivan, G.

Additionally, there are traditional consequences like IT investment losses, and given the magnitude of systems put in place in these kinds of organizations, they encounter the loss of a lot of money and effort when a project fails to deliver its promises Similarly, there are reputation damages which are also a nasty consequence to such large organizations for example, at a revenue authority if the system that deals with customs clearance or tax payments have some problems and there is no adequate governance that ensures the timely recovery or alternative solution this will be in the news the following day. Knowing the problems and associated consequences will assist the IT decision makers in prioritizing activities and solutions for effective IT governance and consequently the improvement in the public service delivery  6. Conclusions In this paper, based on the analysis of five public organizations, we have described IT Governance current practices, problems encountered and the consequences in the public sector in a developing country. The IT Governance mechanisms, together with key focus and decision areas provided the means for a thorough investigation into the studied environment. The combination of these approaches was found to be useful in uncovering practices of interest in this environment, where on one hand IT resources are scarce and its development and management are relatively less established and on the other hand the use of ICT in providing public services is gaining momentum and several efforts are being made to carry it out successfully. The analysis of IT Governance practices in the studied organizations indicate diverse practices in relation to structures processes and relational mechanisms with notable weakness in the processes where, in contrast with developed world, best practices are rarely applied in most of them It was also noted that improvement on these practices are being done continually, not as a specific IT Governance project but rather as normal improvement to increase the IT contribution to the organizational goals. The analysis revealed a number of problems and their consequences in the organizations. The problems we found are categorized in the IT Governance key focus areas, and are including the lack of a specific IT strategic plan in most of them; lack of business people ownership in ITenabled projects; inadequate or absent ICT policies and procedures; lack of IT Governance awareness and guidelines; inadequate follow-up and enforcement mechanisms; and lack of clear roles, responsibilities and accountability. Others problems found are a weak risk-based approach in designing and operating IT related services; attracting and sustaining skilled and competent IT personnel; inadequate budget for required IT resources; fragmented IT initiatives with a loss of synergies and exploitation of the economies of scale; high cost of IT with lower business value; and weak measures of IT performance and value to business In addition, to the problems and challenges in the public sector, several consequences that can be detrimental to the efforts towards effective IT Governance and hence improvements in the public service delivery were also revealed. The most common ones include the difficulty of holding individuals accountable for their results; ad-hoc solutions due to user and management frustrations; and traditional consequences like IT investment losses and damage to the reputation of the organization in question  References  T GI En terpris e Value: Gov e rn a n ce of IT Investments, The Val IT Framework, 2006.

The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
