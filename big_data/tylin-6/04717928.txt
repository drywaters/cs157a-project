To get a complete, fr esh and relevant information close to the IS users needs is a very difficult task, sometime impossible. We try to suggest a non-intrusive solution facilitating this task and transpar ent to the users, relaying on some concepts like \223referential repository\224, \223a priori\224 connector and semantic descriptions. Our approach aim to improve the IS organization by combining th ese concepts and technical information integration solutions I  II 
 III  INTRODUCTION Our business core is the transport of goods and passengers by rail, but severa l branches contribute to our main activity. Thus, our company employs more than 160000 persons that work to carry more than one thousand million of passengers and 100 m illion tones of freight per year, and nearly 150 professions are represented Considering these conditions, our internal IS must be suited to all activities responding to a great degree of complexity At the beginning of this paper we describe the context and main difficulties encountered in our IS. After that some solutions to improve its organization and efficiency are suggested and some perspectives are presented 
C OMPANY 222 S CONTEXT  One of the first contextual difficulties comes from the geographical spread of the company to a national level and the dispersion of information all over several remote locations and business units. Thus, information exists, but it is very difficult to exactly know where it is stored Moreover information exchange is not suitable According to the human point of view, exchanges are performed at verbal and informal levels. When there are formal exchanges between applicati ons, they follow a logical point-to-point way and such links are unstructured. Users 
can\222t have an IS overview and it\222s impossible to exactly know location of pertinent information Another contextual difficulty is the large number of business activities First, these activities change various information, or properties of a given data. Often, central databases cannot be immediately available. Since nothing better appears, business leaders have created copies of part of the central databases, accord ing to their needs, without tracing them in the central databases. Finally, nobody is able to identify \223ONE reference for a database\224, providing in real time the right information. Secondly, this heterogeneity also involves mu ltiple structures and formats 
for data storage which depends on computer technology used by different trades, imposing some practices to store and organize information, and we must respect some cognitive practices hardly changeable for users So the IS has been considerably developed through time and we must consider the history of its heritage. Our aim is not to reappraise all these developments but to integrate and make all these systems interact. To correct these problems, our way is based on the identification of some key points that considers the human and technological issues I DENTIFIED KEY POINTS  Four key elements were identified and defined as essential elements of our project. They 
are: \223referential repository\224 or metamodel repositories\biguity of the information\224 a priori connector\224 and \223interoperability\224  We propose to develop a system architecture model, based on these four key concepts Referential repository In our company, we find a lot of repositories: data warehouse repository, knowledge repository, enterprise repository, trade repository etc. But this is specific to a particular trade or company\222s branch. Our aim is to make real collaboration between all these company\222s actors, in order to discover relevant information, merging all company\222s knowledge 
Our purpose is to create a global system based on an ontological model \(called refe rential repository\bing all these repositories. The system must respond in real time to some questions, such as \223where, when, by who and how\224 data have been changed To respect the constraint of the company, our \223common referential repository\224 must be proposed as a new level over the actual organization. This approach must be combined with a previous solution based on Topic Maps technology http://www.topicmaps org/xtm/index.html  


 Ambiguity of information This previous implementati  has creat ed a common space where few references of the company have been linked, based on the idea of ontology. This permits the users to visually evaluate the overwhelming quantity of information and the great number of descriptions for a given object, depending on the specific developed trades. It is impossible for a single human to have a precise idea about all this information, and to eliminate all of the ambiguities about information, or data For example \223employee\224 is a main concept used in numerous data exchanges. This concept is related to other concepts such as "Address", \223p rofessional status\224, etc. Few people exactly know what involves "professional status for a "permanent" or for a contractual employee". The combination or expansion of these concepts provides 223information\224. For example we can find: \223agent fiscal address\224. It specifies an \223 indicator of agent fiscal address\224 for an application, or an index of agent fiscal address" for another application. Serious ambiguity problems still exist It is difficult to know what the difference of denomination means and if the "index" used for an application is the same as the "indicator" used in another application These ambiguities could be reduced by defining an intelligent data description based on domain ontology Moreover, to elaborate best solutions, we propose to investigate the areas of knowledge management and Semantic We 3 7  IV  V  N EW CONNECTOR 222 S CONCEPT  Connector\222s typology Tools which assure data exchanges between applications, provides connectors built in their communication layer. For example, an EAI \(Enterprise Application Integration sy st em can provi de t echni cal  connectors \(such as XML, EDI, ODBC, JDBC, COM CORBA, ORB, etc.\205\ication connectors \(such as ERP, CRM, G-PAO, e-commerce, BI etc 223A priori connector\224 In our approach, we propose to introduce a new concept of "connector" closely linked to the notion of a priori 224 So, for us, an a priori connector\224 is a \223logical channel\224 enabling to share information in a common area, as it is produced, even before defining prior specifications by an end user Our problem to define functional \223a priori connectors\224 refers to the problems of information sharing. In terms of definition, we forget the con cept of \223bridge\224, to keep the concept of "logical channel\224 For the company\222s culture the bridge refers to the c oncept of physical technical implementations, whereas we are putting emphasis, in a first step, on human practices based on the concept of sharing and collaboration, regardless of the physical implementation. In this context, the supplier is playing an active role in the same way as the user. He is not passive nor does waiting for some need specification. He is active he is providing exactly what he has produced and displaying his information through the communication channels, to the space-shari ng, on his own initiative. For example, in the enterprise, there is a basis for data referential of employees. Only very few specialists in the field of human resources, may know the agents code identifying, which permits to access to users data However, the goal of most of project managers is not to know confidential data about an agent nor his ID code. The interest is to know employees\222 competences. Thus, various information channels, and vari ous applications can provide information about employees. So, the idea is to be able to exactly know them. Only one person cannot know all the enterprise applications which can provide useful descriptions on agents, and therefore, she will not be able to define his needs, to specify a query to his information providers. Hence we propose the idea of a priori  connectors\224 which permits to all applications to provide their information in the co mmon area of the company But to make this information readable, it is necessary to have \223 a priori 224 interoperable connectors Interoperability A priori connector\222s interoperability results in two forms trade and technological interoperability Trade interoperability is related to a common language between different trades, about the same concepts. That involves establishing common knowledge bases to the company where concepts are described and similar meanings should be underlined. Technological inte roperability is rather tied to the choice of an infrastructure with an ar chitecture that supports the latest technology for interoperability based on the XML la  M ODELING  In order to establish a dialogue with clients, we have formalised a functional IS model, completed by a global architecture model Functional model Our representation is based on a layered model \(Figure1  


Figure 1 Layered system\222s functional model Two layers should be maintained: the existing company\222s legacy layer and the user layer. As indicated the company\222s heritage must be integrated including its history and its technologies. Our proposal is to be the least intrusive or the most transp arent possible for these two layers. Currently, users access di rectly to a third layer which is the connectors layer This must be improved and adapted to the next layer\222s prerogatives. So, our solution tries to introduce a new layer decomposed in a sub-layer model and another sub - layer metamodel domain. To be able to interact with the customer, we have oriented our study towards technologies and infrastructures provided by the domain dealing with these two layers \(\247VI. The proposed solution Architecture model According to the needs and requirements specified by the customer, and by mutual agreement, we have developed and formalized an architectural model \(Figure 2 Our added value is related to the referential of data base repository layer that will contain the modeling \(model and metamodel\layer of the solution. This referential repository information will se rve as an interface between the user and the enterprise assets. Most of the actual problems lie at this level. In this first model, we use the concept of a registry \(like UDDI registry 1 n order to allow a dialogue with company\222s actors. With our study\222s refinement and our proposal 222s development, we will introduce the two sub-layers of modeling. The first sub layer model will     1  http://www.uddi.org/pubs/uddi_v3.htm  Figure 2. Global architecture model correspond to the UDDI Registry concept and the second sub layer meta-model will correspond to an ontological description of information domain. That is where the organization of information must be studied and where the Semantic Web can bring a solution  VI  T HE PROPOSED SOLUTION  Several technologies for integrating information emerged with the IS evoluti  We carried out a comparative study in order to choose the best solution for our context and our prerogatives Technologies comparison The first studied is the ETL Extract Transform Load technology It has al ready been devel oped si nce 70\222s and it is well-known by our customers and different actors of the business area Next, we examined the EAI Technology \(Enterprise Application Integration 9 present i n t h e fi el d of research since 90 years and actually considered like an emergent technology in the company. Finally, we studied the EII technology \(Enterprise Information Integration   whi c h i s real l y em ergi ng, si nce t h e begi nni ng of 2000 A first comparison criterion is their functioning The solution Thanks to a comparison between these technologies, we have chosen the best one for our solution. So, in our project, the data exists some where, but the access is very hard. The project managers or architects  especially need fragments of information like a database repository localization containing a given data, its guarantor, the connection mode, the data update frequency, etc. So, an overview of business information and/or data coming from multiple sources is needed. Additionally, we have to respect some data quality criteria, such as freshness or relevance to the context of use. These criteria involve concepts of time and dynamic exchange. In fact, these reasons drive us to select the EII technology. Respective systems are composed of three main parts: the information producer or provider, an assembly and disassembly site and a user \(Figure 3   a priori connecto r shared by Figure 3. EII system\222s functioning m embershi p relation 


ESB infrastructure The ESB infrastructure supports a SOA-based architecture, the concept of \223loose coupled\224 between applications [1] and the serv ices management according to a model domain of these servi C onsi d eri ng our connector\222s definition, there are concepts corresponding to a priori connector\222s notion. The ESB has been designed for bearing the EAI difficulties They appear more modular and scalable. We are studying this scalability. The bus manages services thanks to the orchestration choreography, mediation and discovery. The semantic descriptions of services and their organization make possible these actions. Thereafter our studies will focus on the standard\222s implementation of Semantic Web Services  3 7 and t h ei r cont ri but i ons t o our sy st em  VII    PERSPECTIVES Thanks to our solution we can highlight some perspectives which can be organized in two categories: \223formalization and modeling aspect\224 and 223practical evaluation\224 A  Formalization - Modeling Thus we will focus on the flow of technology and Semantic Web concepts in international trade applications This will be done in part of the ESB infrastructure based on SOA \(Service Oriented Architecture  e will study the semantic standards description of services such OWL-S 2 and SAWSDL 3 The goal is to define and describe our model and meta-model of the domain involving these services B  Experimentation and practical evaluation Another line of work is the research and the comparison of different orchestration and mediation models, in order to select relevant patterns services bus to our study context The purpose of our experimentation is to gradually increase the degree of complexity in the search of a specific service, the size and structure of messages exposed and to explore the limits of the system and its feasibility thresholds. By studying the field gradually, we hope to offer a generic model, adaptable to other contexts of the company, with associated recommendations for use, and functional requirements. And it is precisely here that the two areas must merge. As indicated, we follow an incentive way to integrate our customers in our project. First, we have proposed a bus \(ALSB of BEA 4 exposing a very small number of services in order to obtain some visible results immediately noticeable or perceptible by the customer. We wish to increase the number of offered services and move to a domain more and more evolved Therefore, the second step will be to put the emphasis on  2  http://www.w3.org/Submission/2004/07 3  http://www.w3.org/TR/sawsdl 4  http://e-docs.bea.com/alsb/docs20/index.html composition \(simple or aggregat es\according to criteria such as business management rules or existing bus patterns. In this way, we attempt to increase the degree complexity by creating new business processes through the orchestration of services VIII  C ONCLUSION  Our research is strongly applied to a big corporation\222s IS which has a lot of specificities and exceptions in its profession. That has guided our approach, in addition to the IS users. Therefore, we star ted with a comparative study between different technologies in data integration to continue with a comparison between various infrastructures supporting the exchange of such data. To optimize these exchanges, to be as least intrusive as possible, and propose a global model of exchange adapted to the size of related IS, we advocate a system that primarily supports information\222s descriptions. Indeed, the company has already established systems, tested data exchange, but weaknesses still remain in the exchange of information related to this data We believe that information produced by anyone within the enterprise must be seen as a service provided to the whole company. Our problematic focuses on the data access and their federation, the implementation of the common information\222s sharing area will take the form of an Enterprise Service Bus \(ESB  Thus, the management of these services brings us back to the management of shared information. We will therefore continue to explore standards that exist for the organization and management of services and the information conveyed by an ESB R EFERENCES   1  Chappell D., 2004.

implementation of this clustering algorithm will not suffe r the same speed limitations of software Hardware maps the clustering algorithm onto an FPGA that allows for signicant parallelism The results of the packet loss at the gateway no de are presented in Figure 11 The number of packets that are unable to be clustered varies from 27,000 to 209,000 packets  Figure 9 illustrates the amount of trafc in and out of the gat eway node The average packet size received at the gateway is 217 bytes Each node generates 9,090 packets In the 75 node example 9090 x 75  681,750 packets are destined for the GW node The GW was only able to receive 434,995 packets and the others were dropped due to an overloaded CPU The total trafc received at the GW was 217  434,995  94,393,915 bytes or approximately 94 Mbytes Figure 6 depicts the amount of trafc generated in the network as the number of nodes increased from 10 to 75 From this gure the JXTA P2P Multicast protocol is the most expensive implementation to distribute trafc to all nodes U sing either IP Multicast or Ethernet Broadcast is signicant ly less expensive From these results the IP Multicast protocol was selected as the protocol to deploy in the software and hardware clustering applications These simulations help ed to demonstrate the problems of deploying the JXTA P2P at the Gateway Cluster Node This protocol would create additional CPU and network load to further degrade the performance of the clustering From Figure 6 the overhead associated with sending the same information using JXTA Multicast required 17 times the total bandwidth This overhead comes from the additional complexity of pushing multicast state information encapsulated with each message using overlays to the application layer Thus it is possible to predict 138,087,788  17  2,347,492,396 bytes or approximately 2.3 Gigabytes of trafc destined for the gateway node if P2P multicast is chosen as the distribution method The GW node would be able to process signicantly less if conventional hardware is used Testing conrms that even a 3 Ghz CPU could not keep up with receiving and clustering of the smaller multicast packets which necessitates the use of FPGA or ASIC technology 7 H ARDWARE A RCHITECTURE Advanced SA requires the use of high speed networks with increased bandwidth to implement centralized track fusion to improve

tering system receives the track the system compares the ti me received to the time sent If this time is greater than the tim ing threshold the system will allow the message to pass and update the cluster received time in the table However if th e time is less than the time threshold the system updates the cluster received time and removes the message from the outgoing trafc 10 H ARDWARE F ABRICATION The implementation on the NetFPGA platform was able achieve a clock frequency of 125 MHz The hardware utilization of a track clustering algorithm with four parallel distance metrics is shown in Table 1 With a slice utilization of 44 the number of distance metrics can be increased This increase in parallel distance calculation reduces the late ncy to compare incoming tracks to all known clusters XC2VP50 Utilization Resources Utilization Percentage Slices 10533 out of 23616 44 4-input LUTS 14318 out of 47232 30 Flip Flops 12958 out of 47232 27 Block RAMs 82 out of 232 35 External IOBs 353 out of 692 51 Table 1  Device utilization for XC2VP50 Hardware Track Clustering with four concepts Given our implementation with four parallel distance metri cs with 100 total tracks in the cluster table at any one time we can estimate the total time for clustering an incoming track  The parallel distances can be calculated in four cycles The total number of cycles required to produce all 100 distances would be 100 Since the operation of the clustering circuits are pipelined the accept module would only require three cy cles for determining the correct action to perform The upda te module would require three cycles to perform an update or creation of a new cluster The time table compare takes three cycles Add in an additional four cycles for header processing and we have a total of 113 cycles Since we are running the hardware at 125 Mhz the total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates requ ires 0.904  s for each incoming track This gives us an approximate throughput of 1.1 million packets per second 11 C ONCLUSIONS The results show that the real time hardware using the Kmean algorithm for clustering can accurately locate redundant track data for aggregation identify new tracks and se lect the critical tracks to be forwarded to other distributed sen sor nodes for fusing Improvements in the information quality and latency for distributed track fusion were demonstrated using advanced clustering Track data distributed using multicast is shown to generate 2.3 Gigabytes of trafc for large scale 75 nodes fusion Experiments revealed state-of-the-art CPUs could not handle bursts of packets received which resulted in loss of pack ets due to network buffer overow The clustering gateway node was shown to provide an 18 to 48x reduction in bandwidth through eliminating redundant data The results were tested in a distributed environment called Emulab that used a software version of the clustering algorithms State-oftheart Emulab CPUs could not keep up with the track data resulting in network buffer overow and loss of packets This illustrates the need for our special processing solution us ing FPGA technology Real time clustering is implemented in the network layer OS I layer 3 to reduce the bandwidth intelligently while mainta ining high information content Our pipelined hardware desig n calculates four parallel distance metrics for 100 total tra cks in 100 cycles The total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates is only 0.904  s for each incoming track The hardware solution is prototyped using the Stanford NetFPGA in the Boeing Center for Intelligent Networked Systems CINS lab Our real time solution preserves Layer 7 resources and decreases latencies The ability to add real time hardware in t he network layer improves MTT performance in bandwidth limited environments ultimately preserving legacy avionic ne twork resources 12 F UTURE W ORK Novel methods to illustrate the increased value of information using clustering over normal queuing methods was constructed based on spatial methods Our use of clustering algorithms was fairly limited with K-means however there are plans to implement solutions based on N-means algorithms in the future We realize selection of the correct clusterin g thresholds must be dynamic based on the separation of target s and is highly dependent on accurately projecting the centro id The relationship between our temporal and spacial clusteri ng algorithms must be integrated into a single solution We pla n to develop dynamic clustering thresholds for more accurate prediction of target paths while selectively reducing the d istribution bandwidth Real time assessment of the information value allows us to dynamically adjust the thresholds fo r preserving the key observations We theorize that changing the update rates proportionally with the target velocity wi ll provide improved information value We also plan to add a weighting factor to take into account proximity sensor acc uracy and threat level will provide a more intelligent soluti on Interconnecting the time increment used in the projection o f the clustering centroid with the temporal target rate will s implify the algorithms and hardware Reliable transfer of data using wireless is available in sev eral avionic systems and will be evaluated as a separate test case Latency will denitely increase if all dropped packet s are transferred as required by reliable transport 10

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didn’t measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

Our current implementa tion does not support documents with “variable-le ngth arrays” – lists of identically structured elements with non-fixed lengths Otherwise identically structured documents with different array lengths are currently considered as having different structure We are currently working on supporting “variablelength arrays” to extend the applicability of Structure Encoding. We are also looking at provide similar, but less aggressive, optimization support for schemaconforming documents REFERENCES  Nokia Web Services – Helping Operators Mobilize the Internet Http://www.projectliberty.org/resources/whitepapers/W S_Operators_A4_0408.pdf  The SAX Project. http://www.saxproject.org  XML Pull Parsing. http://www.xmlpull.org  W3C Document Object Model http://www.w3.org/DOM  WAP Binary XML Content Format http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml  Efficiency Structured XML. http://www.esxml.org  VTD-XML. http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net  XSLTC Documentation. http://xml.apache.org/xalanj/xsltc  kXML. http://www.kxml.org  Liefke, H. and D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
