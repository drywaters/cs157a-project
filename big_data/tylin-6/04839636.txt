  1 Three-Dimensional Tools for Telemetry Visualization and Analysis John R. Wright Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology 4800 Oak Grove Dr Pasadena, CA  91109 818-393-2706 john.r.wright@jpl.nasa.gov Abstract 227Monitoring of spacecraft and robotic activities both in realtime and after the fact, can benefit from the use of three-dimensional visua lization tools and spacecraft models.  The simple case of animating a robot model based on a telemetry stream provides an intuitive understanding of the robot's activities that far exceeds that available through dials, graphs, and other common widgets.  The addition of such widgets into the three-dimensional environment, in 
conjunction with the robot model, enhances understanding while focusing attention on critical areas  The design and architecture of visualization tools for analyzing spacecraft state were developed to facilitate the association of telemetered data channels to the three dimensional model of the spacecraft or robot.  In addition the development of custom indicators for any data channel helps to produce a tool geared to maximizing the understanding of the spacecraft's state. Indicators can be enabled or disabled to allow an operator to focus on key data values for a specific activity In addition to the three-dimensional visualization capabilities, standard graphing and plotting tools allow review of telemetry histories and playback of histories through the animation within the 3D environment.  These 
capabilities allow for rapid assimilation of spacecraft activities and state.  In addition to telemetry histories, the results of pre-activity simulations can be visualized and then visually compared to actual telemetry to verify correct performance.  For in-situ missions, models of the local terrain can be included and interactions between the robot and the terrain analyzed The three-dimensional capabilities presented enhance the understanding of robotic and spacecraft activities and state to improve operations, reliability, and safety 1 2 T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION

 6  1  I NTRODUCTION  The most important requirement for planning and operating robotic missions in space and on planetary surfaces is understanding the past, current, and future state of the robot A variety of tools have been utilized for assisting the operators in understanding robot state.  One of the most powerful is the use of three- dimensional visualization environments with fully articulated robot models driven by telemetry and simulation data.  These tools enable the understanding of both robot state and its relationship to the external environment. [1  3 4  5 Fo r in situ  activ ities three-dimensional terrain models can be visualized to aid in 
assessing state and future activities. [6  8  However, simply animating an articulated spacecraft model is often insufficient to convey cr itical state information to an operator.  In many inst ances, the spacecraft body or components will obscure the vi ew of other components Displaying multiple views of the spacecraft from a variety of angles is cumbersome, difficult to grasp visually, and still fails to make internal components visible.  In addition, some telemetered data has no direct visual component.  This paper discusses ways of adding visual components to telemetered data that are easily visualized and understood by the operator to convey more state information The visual components, called indicators, are intended to 
be displayed within the 3D visualization environment, in conjunction with a robot model, such that the indicator's shape, color, size, or other attributes vary in proportion to a telemetered data channel.  The selected data channels can be information that is difficult to quantify visually, such as tilt  or i n form at i on t h at has no vi sual com ponent such as temperature or force 2  H ISTORY  The use of three-dimensional visualization tools for telemetry analysis at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory began with the Mars Polar Lander mission in 1998.  The 


  2 tools developed for that mission were enhanced and used for the Mars Exploration Rovers missions and have been critical to their success.  They have been enhanced again and used for the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer \(ATHLETE\issions pioneered the use of more sophisticated visualization tools for telemetry analysis of downlinked data.  The ATHLETE project adapted the tools for real-time telemetry visualization, with real-time playback of robotic activities through animation of a robot model.  Specialized indicators for presenting force data that have no corresponding robotic articulation helps focus on key telemetry values that must be monitored during activities The design and architecture of the visualization tool was developed to facilitate the association of telemetered data channels to the three- dime nsional model of the spacecraft  In addition the development of custom indicators for any data channel helps to produce a tool geared to maximizing the unde rstanding of the spacecraft's state. Indicators can be enable d or disabled to allow an operator to focus on key data values for a specific activity Three-dimensional visuali zation of the ATHLETE robot with additional specialized indicators, proved its worth at several field trials.  Early versions of the flight software were able to steer the wheels and drive to designated positions.  However, they were unable to adapt to the terrain and perform force equalization.  If the robot drove over a small hump in the terrain, the leg on top of the hump would have large forces on it while the two adjacent legs would have low forces.  Numeric displays continually updated to show the magnitudes of the individual leg forces. However in the operational environment it was often too difficult to be able to continually monitor those values.  Placing indicators in the 3D environment allowed the operators to tell at a glance how well balanced the forces were and which legs were the most out of balance.  Then the operators were able to perform corrections to balance the forces.  When later versions of the flight software were able to adaptively balance the forces while driving, the indicators provided quick feedback on th e efficacy of the algorithms In addition to the three-dimensional visualization capabilities, standard graphing and plotting tools allow review of telemetry histories and playback of histories through the three-dimensional visualization.  These capabilities allow for rapid assimilation of spacecraft activities and state.  In addition to telemetry histories, the results of preactivity simulations can be visualized and then visually compared to actual telemetry to verify correct perform 12 For i n si t u m i ssi ons, m odel s of t h e local terrain can be included and interactions between the robot and the terrain analyzed 3  I MPLEMENTATION  The 3D visualization environment is based on standard 3D rendering tools. Existing versions are based on Open Performer, an API from Silicon Graphics Incorporated, and the GTK user interface toolkit.  The latest version under development is based on Open Inventor for the 3D API and the Qt user interface toolkit The model of the spacecraft is generated from the CAD models used for construction of the spacecraft with some simp lification to make rendering faster.  The model is as fully articulated as possible in order to be able to visualize all motions and the results of all commands. Telemetry channels are attached to the articulated portions of the mode l, either from recorded or simulated telemetry in files or from streaming real-time telemetry from a teleoperated robot.  Changes in telemetered values result in changes in articulations The design of the tools utilizes as much multi-mission capability as possible.  This is done at two levels.  The first is the use of external models loaded from files, for the spacecraft structure and also for the kinematic linkages and articulations.  These provide the ability to do some customization at runtime and efforts have been made to maximize this capability.  The other customization is done at compile time by the use of small customization files driving code generators to build the tool ready for the desired task.  Mission-specific code is isolated to as few modules and libraries as possible 4  T HREE DIMENSIONAL V ISUALIZATION  The use of 3D visualization environments for telemetry and state analysis and understanding has been a big factor in the success of the MER missions. The design and implementation of the tools provided the capability to ingest telemetry data and play it back almost immediately upon receipt. The production of terrain models within minutes of receiving stereo imagery and th eir immediate ingestion into the visualization tool also contributes greatly to the performance of the MER team  Fi gure 1 shows a  Figure 1 \226 MER Rover Drive Visualization 


  3 visualization of a recent drive by the Opportunity rover This type of visualization can be used to evaluate the performance of the rover during traverses and to compare to the planned path for a traverse Similarly, figure 2 shows the state of the MER robotic arm after a set of arm activities.  An operator can verify placement on a target, check th e arm articulations against the predicted position, and pl ay back the activities through an animation process The use of visualization t ools for state analysis has contributed greatly to the continued success of the MER missions.  Original estimates expected that approximately one day of activities would be lost out of every three planned due to errors in the planning process, both human and tools.  With the visualization tools aiding in state analysis and understanding, the actual numbers were on the order of three days lost out of 100 planned. Understanding rover state allowed alternative activities to be planned when other activities were precluded and to avoid many errors before they occurred 5  I NDICATORS  As stated above, however, merely playing back the articulations only effects partial comprehension of the spacecraft state.  Some telemetered values do not directly drive articulation of the model and thus do not affect the visualization.  Of particul ar importance for ATHLETE were the forces on the legs during driving and other maneuvers These forces are partially a f unction of the leg articulations and partially the result of interactions between the legs and the terrain.  To visualize this type of data, the concept of an indicator was developed An indicator is a visualization widget that can be coupled with one or more telemetry channels.  The indicators can be displayed within the 3D environment, in association with the spacecraft model, or in 2D as an overlay on the display window.  Typically, the 3D mode is used.  In addition, the indicators may be associated with the spacecraft model and directly driven by spacecraft stat e or may be driven by other information.  An example of the latter might be indicators showing the direction to the sun, earth, orbiting relay spacecraft, or other external body.  These indicators would be dependent only on time and the spacecraft position, not on any internal stat e of the spacecraft Indicators do not have to be limited to internal spacecraft information. The use of SPICE kernels for tracking bodies within the solar system can be linked to spacecraft position and orientation to drive indicators pointing to important bodies such as the earth and sun.  A vector from an antenna towards earth can quickly identify potential obscurations Similarly, a vector from an in strument towards a target of interest can quickly reveal the visibility of the target Figure 3 shows an example of indicators showing the directions to several bodies as used for the MER mission The orientation of the indicators is driven by the mission clock time, not the rover state In the figure, it can be seen that the tilt of the rover provides a maximum incident solar energy.  Also, the time used fo r the display is near solar conjunction, causing the sun and earth indicators to be closely aligned.  The third indicator shows the location of one of the orbiting relay spacecraft Indicators have use in both in-situ activities on planetary surfaces as well as in teleoperated missions.  Generally operating a robot on a pl anetary surface requires autonomous behavior on the part of the robot and later analysis of activities and state information.  For the Mars Exploration Rovers \(MER\missions, the rovers would send telemetry back to earth at the end of the day's activities The telemetered data had to be analyzed and new command sequences prepared prior to the next day's activities.  The cycle consisted of receiving and processing the telemetry  Figure 2 \226 MER Arm State Visualization  Fi g ure 3 226 E p hemeris Indicators 


  4 and imagery, analysis of teleme try, particularly final state planning of activities, preparation of command sequences verification and validation of command sequences, and finally uplink.  Because the cycle is so short, tools to rapidly convey state information were critical.  For MER, the visualization tools were most useful for evaluating the downlinked telemetry and for reviewing the results of simulation and rehearsal of command sequences for validation and verification.  For example, figure 4 shows the same situation as seen in figure 2 but with the addition of an indicator showing the current tool frame of the arm.  With the addition of the indicator, it is much easier to see that the tool is in fact lined up with the target and the planning team can proceed with the observations.  Figure 5 shows another use of the tool frame indicator For teleoperated robots, such as the ATHLETE robot visualization tools are critical for monitoring current activities.  In this case, it is impossible to replay activities to analyze them from multiple view angles and over different time periods. The operator must grasp critical state information immediately.  In this case, it is even more important to incorporate indicators for key telemetry channels that add information to the display without visually challenging the operator.  It is easy to overwhelm the visual system with too much information so the selection of telemetry channels to display and the design of the indicators can be very important Most often, the indicators ar e associated w ith the spacecraft state data and are associated in the 3D environment with the spacecraft model.  Figure 6 shows the simple force indicators associated with the ATHLETE model legs. The upper image shows the leg forces to be in near balance while the middle image shows the legs significantly out of balance.  The lower image s hows the state of the force indicators when the forces ar e all zero.  Generally this indicates that telemetry is not being received by the application and is immediately obvious to the operator In addition to the leg force indicators, a simple set of leg ID indicators is also in use here.  The actual ATHLETE robot model does not distinguish the individual legs so indicators are used to label the corners to identify the legs within the visualization environment.  Thes e can also be seen in figure 6.  Other indicators available include axes to identify the coordinate frame of the robot or currently selected tool, as seen in Figure 7, and also to display the location of a target being tracked by the onboard docking software 6  F UTURE D EVELOPMENT  Future developments in the use of 3D visualization environments and the use of state-based indicators are virtually unlimited.  Each project or mission will have specific requirements for their tools to support commanding and analysis for that spacecraft Current efforts are centered on developing the capabilities required for MSL, including developing 3D visualization tools in a more open and supported 3D API and developing the specific set of indicators desired for the mission.  Coordinate frame tools will be of use during development to track transformations of locations from one frame to another. Pointers to solar system bodies will be used dur ing operations to evaluate instrument pointing and occlusion with rover components and nearby terrain.  Tool frame indicators will be used for aligning tools mounted on the arm with appropriate targets While these indicators are adaptations of ones used for MER, MSL can benefit from new indicators for displaying the forces on the robotic arm joints, field of regard for various instruments, and availability of analysis and sampling resources  Figure 4 \226 MER Tool Frame Indicator  Figure 5 \226 MER Tool Frame Indicator 2

The use of indicators within the 3D environment adds an extra capability for state visualization and comprehension.  The indicators described here are only examples of what can be done to enhance state comprehension and many other types can be envisioned.  The framework now exists to quickly incorporate new types of indicators to existing tools as needed for specific projects and missions A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The work described in this paper was done at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Californi a Institute of Technology under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration R EFERENCES  1  J.

applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to

necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
