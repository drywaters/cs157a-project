An New Algorithm of Association Rule Mining   Jun Gao Shanghai Institute of Technology Shanghai 200235, China gaojun@sit.edu.cn   Abstract  Efficiency is critical to data mining algorithm Based on fully analyzing the PF_growth, an association rule mining algorithm, we in this paper give a new association rule mining algorithm called MFP.  MFP algorithm converts a transaction database to an MFP_tree through scanning the transaction 
database only once, then prune the tree and at last mine the tree.  Because the MFP algorithm scans a transaction database one time less than the FP_growth algorithm, the MFP algorithm is more efficient under certain conditions  1. Introduction  Association rule mining belongs to data mining area.  It is used to search for interesting relationship among items in a large transaction database [1  Boolean association rule mining is used more widely than other kinds of association rule mining.  Its whole 
mining process can be completed in three steps. Firstly the database which will be mined is transformed into a transaction database. And then, some mining method is used to mine out all candidate frequent patterns.  At last, the association rules are created from the candidate frequent patterns. The second stage is the most important. It will decide the correctness and efficiency of the mining process. There are two mining algorithms which are widely used to mine association 
rules. One is Apriori; the other is FP_growth  FP_growth algorithm is more efficient than Apriori Some related research showed that FP_growth algorithm is about one order of magnitude faster than the Apriori [4 T h e larg er th e tran sactio n d a tab a se, th e  higher FP_growth’s efficiency.  The main reason is that Apriori algorithm must scan transaction database being mined several times and FP_growth algorithm need to scan the database only twice.  FP_growth 
 algorithm is  used normally to mine transaction database for Boolean association frequent patterns. Its mining process is quite complicated, and can be divided into three basic stages.  The first stage is to scan the transaction database being mined and construct table L, a set of frequent 1-itemsets, with the value of minimum support count given.  The second stage is to scan the transaction database again, and build an FP_tree. The last stage is to mine the FP_tree and search for all candidate frequent patterns.  After 
we get the patterns, we can construct all association rules from them easily.  Although FP_growth algorithm is more efficient than Apriori algorithm, it scans the transaction database twice. The first time table L is constructed.  The second time, an FP_tree is built.  The cost of scanning a transaction database is usually very high.  If we can decrease the number of scan times of association rule mining algorithms, the algorithms will be even more efficient than FP_growth 
We design a fast association rule mining algorithm called MFP algorithm. MFP algorithm firstly scans a transaction database and converts the database into MFP_tree which is similar to FP_tree, and then, the algorithm mines MFP_tree to find all possible candidate frequent patterns.  Comparing with FP_growth algorithm, MFP algorithm scans a transaction database only once, so it has higher efficiency than FP_growth.  We have not found the similar work so far 
 2. The Principle of the MFP algorithm  We give the following related definitions first  2.1. Related Definition  Definition 1 Transaction database: Transaction database stores transaction records. Every transaction record in a transaction database has a sole identifier and all items included in the transaction record are listed in order. Figure 1 is a simple transaction

database named D.  T001 is the identifier of the first transaction record in D.  Transaction T001 includes items I1, I2, I5, which are listed in the order of the item suffixes  TID List of item_ID’s T001 I1,I2,I5 T002 I2,I4 T003 I2,I3 T004 I1,I2,I4 T005 I1,I3 T006 I2,I3 T007 I1,I2 T008 I1,I2,I3,I5 T009 I1,I2,I3  Fgure 1. Transaction database   Definition 2 MFP_tree: An MFP_tree is composed of a number of tree nodes and a root labeled with null”. Every node has n sub-nodes \(n = 0, 1, 2 When n = 0, the node is called leaf node. We use an MFP_tree to present a transaction database.  A tree node is labeled with the name of an item in the transaction database.  Except of the root, every node in the tree has two fields.  One is Ii.count and the other is Ii.pointer.  The Ii.count is equal to the number of the items, which appear in the nodes, and is displayed in a bracket on the right of the node label.  Ii.pointer is a pointer, which points to its mother node. An example of an MFP_tree is shown in Figure 2  Figure2. MFP_tree  Definition 3 C: Combination C is any combination of nodes \(the root is not included \ a branch from a leaf to the root.  The C is presented with the labels of the nodes combined.  The name has a number in a bracket on the right I4, I5 are leaf nodes in the Figure 2. Because I5.count=1, and there are three nodes I1, I2, I5 on the branch, four compositions are constructed. They are I5, I2}\(1\, {I5, I1}\(1\, {I5, I2, I1}\(1\I2, I1}\(1 There are two nodes I2, I4 on the other branch, and I4.count = 2,   so   we   can    get   the composition of I4, I2 2  Definition 4 Table TL: Table TL consists in three columns showed in Figure 3.  The first column is a list of item_IDs which appear in the transaction database D; the second column is filled with the support count of the item listed in the left column; the third one is made up of the item pointers pointing to its occurrences in the MFP_tree via a chain of node_links Definition 5 Set CF: Set CF is a kind of sets whose element is C   2.2. The principle of MFP Algorithm  The mining process of MFP Algorithm can be divided into three steps.  The first one is to construct MFP_tree; the next is to prune MFP_tree; and the last step is to mine MFP_tree 1\nstructing MFP_tree The root of an MFP_tree labeled with “null” is created first.  Then, the fi rst transaction record is picked up from the transaction database D being mined and inserted into the MFP_tree in the following way The first item of the record is taken out.  If the root of the tree has a sub-node whose label is the same as the label of item just taken out, we add 1 to the node’s count field.  Otherwise, we create a new sub node of the root with the same label as the item.  After that, we use the sub node as a sub tree’s root, take out the next item from the transaction record and insert it into the sub tree in the same way.  The process repeats till all the items in the transaction record are put into the MFP_tree.  In this way, we can insert all the transaction records in D into the MFP_tree and complete the process of converting the transaction database D to the MFP_tree.  In the MFP_tree, one branch from a leaf to the root presents one or more transaction records of D and stores the association information among the items of a transaction record In order to mine an MFP_tree easier, according to Definition 4, the table TL is built.  The first column of the table is filled with the item_IDs which appear in the transaction data base.  Then the corresponding chains of node_links are built so that the occurrences of one item in the MFP_tree are linked together.  After that, each item support count is calculated through the node links and the results are put into the second column of table TL We can convert the transaction database D showed in Figure 1 to the MFP_tree shown in Figure 3.  The number in the bracket on the right side of a node label is the node’s Ii.count value

  Figure 3. The MFP_tree from D  2\Pruning MFP_tree In order to facilitate the MFP_tree mining, we prune the tree according to the value of minimum support count given beforehand. Suppose that the minimum support count is 3 \(i.e. min_sup 3/9 = 33%\ Those items whose support counts are less than 3 are deleted from the table.  All the tree nodes linked with the deleted item in the table are deleted also.  If a deleted node has a sub tree linked, have its sub tree link to its mother node. In the example shown in Figure 3, I4 and I5 in TL are deleted because their support count is less than 3. Their occurrences in MFP_tree are deleted afterward. After pruned, MFP_tree is shown in Figure 4  Figure 4.  The MFP_tree pruned  3\ Mining MFP_tree We take out the first leaf node I3 from the left of MFP_tree.  All of combinations are made up from the nodes \(except the root\ the branch to which the leaf connects.  We then put labels and values to all the combinations according to Definition 3.  After that, we send all combinations into set CF, if there are not the same combination labels in set CF.  Otherwise, we merge the two combinations with the same label by adding together the two count values.  When all combinations of the nodes on the branch are sent into set CF, we modify the nodes on the branch in following way.  The leaf node’s count value is subtracted from every node’s count value \(including the leaf node’s\ the branch.  If a node’s count value on the branch is zero after subtracting, the node will be deleted.  Then we take out the new first leaf node again from the left of MFP_tree and process it in same way On finishing processing the MFP_tree, we delete those combinations in CF, whose count value is less than minimum support count given. After that, all the combinations left in set CF are candidate frequent patterns we want.  We can create all association rules from the combination in set CF, and use min_conf given to find strong association rules.  An example of mining MFP_tree shown in Figure 4 is given below We find leaf nodes I3 which is the first leaf node of MFP_tree from the left, and get the branch node I3, I1 We combine the two nodes to get the combination of I3, I1 1 Because set CF is empty at this moment, the combination enters CF directly.  Then we modify the nodes on the branch, by subtracting the number of the I3.count from the node.counts on the branch.  After subtracting, the I3.count equals 0 and I1.count equals 4.  Because I3.count is zero, the node is deleted from MFP_tree.  Now we take out the new first leaf node of the tree from the left, which is I3 and is the sub node of I2, and repeat the above process.  This time, we get the branch from I3 to the root.  The branch is composed of I3, I2, and I1.  We can get all the combinations from the three nodes {I3,I2,I1 2 I3, I2 2 I3, I1 2 I2 I1 2 and put them into set CF.  Then, we modify the count fields of the three nodes on the branch.  At this time, we subtract the value of I3.count from the nodes counts on the branch.  Because the value of I3.count is 0, the node is deleted and the node I2 becomes the first leaf node of MFP_tree.  We continue the process in the same way till the MFP_tree is empty.  After finishing processing MFP_tree, we get set CF as below CF = {{I3,I1 4 I3,I2,I1 2 I3,I2 4 I3,I1 2 I2,I1 4  We delete those combinations in set CF, whose support count is less than the minimum support count given beforehand, \(minimum support count = 3 in this example\nd obtain set CF as below CF = {{I3,I1 4 I2,I1 4 I3,I2 4   3.

The database has about 50000 transaction records and 100 items. The test results show that two algorithms can mine out the same candidate frequent patterns, but MFP algorithm’s mining efficiency is about 20 higher.  It can be inferred reasonably from the principle of the algorithm that MFP algorithm’s efficiency will get even higher, when a transaction database becomes larger and the number of item_IDs becomes smaller  4. Conclusion  It is very important to have a data mining algorithm with high efficiency because transaction database usually are very large can not be stored in main memory. MFP algorithm can complete the mining process through scanning the transaction database only once. The experiments show that MFP algorithm has higher time efficiency. Because the input of MFP algorithm is the same as those inputs of FP_growth or Apriori, MFP algorithm can be applied to any situation where FP_growth or Apriori algorithm can be used  5.

Finally, shows the extended association rules IV EXPERIMENTS For our experiments we used SQL Server2000 relational DBMS running on a 1.50GHz Pentium M with 504MB RAB The data we used is from the Northwind database of the SQL Server2000 and the relational structure is shown in Fig. 1 The sizes of the tables are as follows The Order Details table has 2155 tuples The Order table has 830 tuples The Customers table has 91 tuples We select 77 kinds of products as the chief attributes to mine the antecedent rules and select Quantity from Order Details table, OrderDate from Order table and ContactTitle and Country from Customers table as the relational attributes to mine the extended consequent rules The minimum support is set 0.5% and the extended minimum confidence is set 40 We will find these antecedent rules containing at least two products Thus, the antecedent rules mined by using our GA will answer the following question What products are frequently ordered together The extended consequent rules mined by using apriori algorithm and statistic method can answer these additional questions as follows How much quantities, what the possible order date is and how the customers are about these products frequently ordered together Figure 6 shows the generations and the number of rules during the GA mining process Table I shows the experimental results after incorporating and extracting the rules containing at least two products Table II shows fourteen extended association rules In the proposed method, the GA found most anteceden t rules.

rules through producing C 830 5 groups while our GA just uses 23968 groups to produce rules. Finally, the extracted extended association rules satisfy the condition of importance and have the qualification for commercial decision. Therefore we need not store retrieve, prune and sort a large number of rules for classification as traditional method V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we introduce a new data mining method to mine rules from multi-relational databases Our approach has two novel points: One is the ideas of distributed mining by using GA and traditional apriori mining algorithm. Another is the definition of the new extended association rule for supporting the commercial decision better. In our experiment the GA based method is more efficient on the antecedent rules mining than the matrix method and the distributed mining method is also different with other multi-relational data mining methods that need query-processing using SQL language The extended association rule has finer pattern and contains more commercial information. Meanwhile, the number of rules is much less than the standard data mining method producing large candidate rules In the future research we will apply our method to the real world databases with large data and intend to combine the fuzzy logic and our method to predict data R EFERENCES  R.

Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
