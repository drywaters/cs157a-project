Firstly according to the rough set theory some improvement is made to the discernible matrix; then with integration of the self-adaptive genetic algorithm, a new knowledge acquisition algorithm to mine the consistent 
rules and inconsistent rules from the incomplete information system is presented. Furthermore according to the study of confidence degree and support degree of association rule in complete information system, the rule confidence degree and support degree is defined within the framework of incomplete information system. Through the examination of experimental results, this algorithm is proved effective, especia lly to large incomplete information systems  1  Introduction  Rough set theory 
 introduced by Z.Pawlak in 1982, is an extension of set theory of intelligent system characterized by insufficient, fuzzy, imprecise and uncertain information. Using the concepts of lower and upper approximations in rough set theory, knowledge hidden in information systems may be discovered and expressed in the forms of decision rules  Two types of decision rules usually may be derived, that is, on one hand, certain rules can be acquired on the basis of 
the lower approximation of a decision class; on the other hand, based on the upper approximation of a decision class, uncertain or partially certain information is acquired and possible rules may be discovered Study of knowledge discovery method from incomplete information system  has become a hotspot since various studies have been carried out and many knowledge discovery approaches have been proposed in this field, such as Kryszkiewicz 3][4][5 who  used the 
extensions of rough set model to reason in incomplete information system with missing values. Lingras and Yao  6 employed two different generalizations of rough set models to generate plausible rules with incomplete information systems. Hong et al 7 proposed a new learning algorithm which can simultaneously derive rules from incomplete information systems. Using the concept of maximal consistent block set, Leung and Li 
8 formulate an approach to acquire knowledge in incomplete system Genetic algorithm, an effective searching and optimizing technique applied widely in scientific study filed, has the good performance of robust and global search. WrOblewski 9 applied the genetic algorithm to find minimal reduction in complete information system and got good results  In this paper, based on an improved discernible matrix and self-adaptive genetic algorithm, we design 
and implement a knowledge discovery algorithm in incomplete information system   2  Preliminaries  To begin with, several necessary concepts of information system are introduced in [3 0   Definition 1 Information system An information system is an ordered quadruple U A, V, f where U is a non-empty finite set of objects A  C  
D is a non-empty finite set of attributes C  denotes the set of condition attributes and D denotes the set of decision attributes C  D    V is the union of attribute domain, and f: U  A  V is an information 


function associating a unique value of each attribute with every object which belongs to U If a is an attribute in A \(a  A  x i an object in U \(x i  U then f  x i  a otes the value of object x i  of attribute a  Definition 2 Rule confidence degree and rule support degree  Rule acquired in the information system usually has two kinds, namely, consistent rules and inconsistent rules. Generally, a consistent rule can be denoted by the following format  Condition 1 Condition 2 Condition n  Conclusion  Whereas the inconsistent rule is more complicated with a confidence degree a 0 a 1\ introduced to denote the rule by the following format Condition 1 Condition 2 Condition n Conclusion  a In an information system U  A  V  f  A  C  D  acquired rules always have  forms like Des  E i  C   Des  X j D  E i  X j    and the confidence degree a of rule as well as the support degree u of rule  are defined below a  E i  X j E i  u  E i  X j U E i   U  IND  C  X j   U  IND  D  E i  is the condition equivalence relation class X j is the decision equivalence relation class in information system, and U is the universe\( a finite set of objects  Obviously, the confidence degree of consistent rule is equal to 1; whereas the confidence degree of inconsistent rule is between 0 and 1. The initialization value of a and u is proposed in advance by the user  Definition 3 Incomplete information system  U  A  V  f is called an incomplete information system if V contains null value for at least one attributes a  A otherwise it is complete. Further on, we will denote null value by  that is f  x i  a    4  Definition 4 Similar relation  Let B  A then a similar relation is derived from B  SIM\(A  x  y   U  U    a   B  f\(x, a  f\(y, a or f\(x a   or f\(y, a    Definition 5 Lower approximation and upper approximation  Let X  U  B  A  B X is lower approximation of X iff  B X  x  U   SIM B x   X  x  X   SIM B x   X  B _ X is upper approximation of X iff B _ X  x  U   SIM B x  X     SIM B x  x  X   3  Rule extraction algorithm  3.1. Improved discernible matrix  In practical application, if interest is only paid to the decision rules acquired from the information system and not more attention is paid to differentiate all similar relation in the decision information system, the decision information system is grouped to some decision equivalence class in terms of difference value of decision attributes  Obviously, each object in X j has some differences really, and if only the impact from condition attributes is considered about decision equivalence class, the difference of each object in X j will be ignored. In this sense, the proposed method is to focus on the core of question and reduce the compute complexity The improved discernible matrix is defined as follows Definition: An incomplete information system U  A  V  f  A  C  D  B  A, S i S j  U  SIM  B  i j=1,2  n  n  U  SIM  B   X k  U  IND  D  D is the set of decision attributes k=1,2  m  m  U  IND  D  The improved discernible matrix  is a  n X n square matrix M s  B  M s  i,j  n X n 1 012 i, j 012 n where the discernible matrix  M s  i, j defined as follows     Va l u e o f M s  i, j  NULL which denotes the difference is ignored in the similar relations. Obviously, the improved matrix is a symmetry matrix, because with some NULL value neglected, the compute complexity is greatly reduced  3.2. Rule Confidence degree and rule support degree in incomplete information system  Based on the definition 3, 4 and 5, acquired rules always have  forms like Des  S i  C   Des  X j D  S i  X j    the confidence degree and the support degree u  are defined subsequently in an incomplete information system U  A  V  f  A  C  D  a i  S i  X j S i  u i  S i  X j U S i   U  SIM  C  X j   U  SIM  D  S i is the condition attributes similar relation class and X j is the decision attributes similar relation class in information system and U is the universe\( a finite set of objects\. Based on the study of [3     d  D  f  x i  d    comes the SIM  D  IND  D  X j   U  IND  D  Owing to the complication of incomplete information system and character of similar relation, if two objects which included in the same condition attributes similar relation S i ave the different decisive attributes, a clash will emerge. According to the definition 2, the acquired rule can be depicted by the form of Condition 1 Condition 2 Condition        ikjk s ii NULL if i j S X S X Mij aifaBaSaS     


n Conclusion1  Conclusion2  a  a r  max a ri   a rj and u r   u ri  u rj In this way every clash discussed above can be discernible  3.3. Rule extracting algorithm in incomplete information system  In terms of improved discernible matrix, the rule extraction algorithm in incomplete information system is described as follows Input: the initial incomplete information system U  A  V  f  A  C  D  B  A , a 0 u 0  Output: rule set R  r  R  r a  a 0 r u u 0  Step 1: Data pretreatment Step 2: In terms of condition attributes set C  B  C Group the decision information system to some object similar relation classes S i  S i  U  SIM  B  i=1,2  U  SIM  B  Step 3: In terms of decision attributes set D Group the decision information system to some decision object equivalence relation classes X j  X j  U  IND  D  j=1,2  U  IND  D  Step 4: Find the minimal attributes reduction with the optimization of self-adaptive genetic algorithm and acquire the decision rules, with the detail introduced in section 4 Step 4: Based on result of the minimal attributes reduction, induce the decisive rules, that is, when  S i  X j  is satisfied, the certain rules are obtained; when S i  X j  and S i  X j     are satisfied, the uncertain rule is obtained, where confidence degree a is S i  X j S i   and support degree u is S i  X j U  Step 5: If the acquired rule which confidence degree a 015 a 0 and support degree u 015 u 0 are respectively satisfied, can be credited as an anticipant rule and output to the rule set, otherwise discard it. If acquired two rules with the same condition attributes have the different decisive attributes, how one is selected is decided by the confidence degree and support degree if two rules are satisfied, it turns out a decision composite rule   4  Self-adaptive genetic algorithm  Genetic algorithm, an effective searching and optimizing technique applied widely in scientific study filed, has a good performance of robust and global search. When it is applied to optimize the rule extraction algorithm, the main arithmetic operators include selection operator, crossover operator mutation operator to individuals, and especially include the fitness function which is used to estimate the individual good or not  In order to apply self-adaptive genetic algorithm to acquire knowledge from incomplete information system, a binary discernible matrix on the basis of section 3.2 is proposed in terms of the condition attributes 1    i   1,2….n  e co n d itio n at trib u t es x k  x n are two objects  denotes a missing attribute value. If a i x i     it  indicates that the attribute a i  of object x k  is unknown  4.1. Depiction of chromosome  Based on the definition of the binary discernible matrix, it is easy to express a chromosome. The length of chromosome is the number of the condition attributes, 1 expresses that the corresponding attributes are useful, and 0 tells us that attributes are redundant If an information system has N  N>0 ndition attributes then it can be expressed by a N bit binary string  4.2. Fitness function  Fitness function is a sole measure standard to estimate the individual good or not, which is the key operator. In this paper we adopt the method in [1  The reduction of incomplete information systems can be implemented based on similarity relation. If the similarity relations of objects before or after reduction are the same, then it is a reduction, so the fitness function may be chosen as follows f  v    where   is the number of the same similarity relation of the attribute subset B with the attributes set C in incomplete information systems. If the similarity relations of objects before or after reduction are same completely   is best. So it is reasonable to choose   as fitness functions  4.3. Selection operator, crossover operator and mutation operator   Roulette wheel method, adopted in this paper, is a common selection method. There are parameters of individual fitness, selection probability and cumulating probability in the roulette wheel. After going through the cross and mutation at the early stage, the M random ethnic groups will in accordance with the principle of retaining individuals with high adaptability use the Roulette wheel to produce next generation How to set crossover rate and mutation rate has profound influence on the performance of algorithm On one hand, while the too low crossover rate is not 1    0  ik in ik in ik in if ax ax bi kn if ax ax or ax or ax    


favorable to the reorganization of genes, the too high one is liable to destroy some good individual; On the other hand, while the too small mutation rate leaves the problem of effective genetic default uneasy to solve the too high one is prone to lose track of the existent effective genes The basic principle of algorithm involved in this paper is, by means of involuntarily adapting crossover rate and mutation rate in accordance with the fitness and characteristics of individuals and communities, not only to consistently retain diversity of communities during the whole course of evolution, but also to attain the aim of improving genetic algorithm, constringent speed as well as its performance  To quantitatively describe the characteristics of distribution shared by current community, this paper uses the following formula to indicate the performance  l n H n i n i j j i 2 11  4      H i,j denotes  the Euclid distance between the chromosome i and chromosome j  n the amount of genes in the community l the length of chromosome   w h en   0, every chromosome in this community is totally the same; when  1, the possibility of 0 or 1 in every chromosome occupies 50 percent of possibilities, or in other words, it is a random distribution in terms of 0 and 1   In this paper, two-point crossover is adopted. The specific formulae of self adapting crossover rate and mutation rate are shown below    max max  1.0 avg avg c avg ff f f ff P f f     012  012       avg avg avg m f f f f f f f f C P 2  0  1  max max   P c denotes the crossover rate P m the mutation rate f max denotes the maximal fitness and f avg the average fitness f  a value of fitness of the individual which has the bigger fitness value between the crossover individuals f denotes the fitness value of mutation individual, and C the constant coefficient in the process of algorithm evolution, is always a very small real number The crossover probability P c controls frequency of crossover operation. The bigger value of P c it is, the better ability to find new searching area the genetic algorithm has, but it is easy to lose the individuals of high performance; and the too small value of P c will lead to rather slow change of searching area. In order to protect individuals with high performance, the crossover probability usually should be small Mutation operator is the assistant operator of genetic algorithm. It mainly keeps the diversity of individuals and protects the algorithm from converging too early. Mutation probability P m should be generally small in order to prevent the loss of elite individual In view of the definition of P c and P m when the best solution is approaching, reduce the P c and P m  when keep away form the solution space, increase the P c and P m that is, the solution of higher fitness has smaller P c and P m and vice versa  Protecting the high fitness individual is useful to hold the algorithm convergence to the global best solution. In this paper, by self-adaptively adjusting the value of P c and P m not only avoids algorithm converging to the local best solution, but also prevents the destroying of elite genes  5  Experiments  In order to validate our algorithm proposed in section 3, here we employ an example in w h i c h depicts an incomplete information system containing information about cars, to illustrate some concepts and computations involved in our proposed method. Here in this example Price  Mileage  Size and Max-Speed  are the condition attributes of the system, where d is the decision attribute. \(In the sequel P  M  S and X will stand for Price  Mileage  Size and Max-Speed  respectively Table 1  Incomplete car table  Car Price Mileage Size Max-Speed d 1 high low full low good 2 low  full low good 3  compact low poor 4 high  full high good 5  full high excellent 6 low high full  good In this table, the * denotes unknown attributes values. Based on the algorithm proposed in section 3 the knowledge can be discovered from above incomplete information system. The details can be elaborated as follows The initial confidence degree a 0  and support degree  u 0 are set as follows a 0  0.5 u 0 0.1; Condition attributes set C  P M  S  X and decision attributes D  d  According to the algorithm step 2, similar relation equivalence classes of condition attributes can be counted out, seen from the results below  S 1 1  S 2 2 6 S 3 3 S 4 4 5 S 5 4 5 6 S 6 2 5 6 U  SIM C  1 } , { 2 , 6 } , { 3 } , { 4 , 5 } , { 4 5 , 6 } , { 2 , 5 , 6  


In the meanwhile, according to the step3, decision attributes equivalence class can be counted out below X 1 1 2 3 4 X 2 3 X 3 5 U  IND D 1 , 2 , 4, 6 } , { 3 } , { 5 Additionally, according to the step 4 of knowledge acquisition algorithm using the self-adaptive genetic algorithm discussed in section 4 for above incomplete information system, the best chromosome 0011 is found, that is, the condition attributes Size  S d Max-Speed  X two key attributes in this information system. As a result, the acquired rules from this incomplete information system are as follows r1  S, full\ and \(X, low  d, good r2  S, full\ and \(X, low  d, good r3:  \(S, compact  d, poor r4  S, full\ and \(X, high  d, good r5:  \(S, full  d, good r6:  \(S, full  d, excellent Because S 1  X 1  S 2  X 1 S 3  X 2 are satisfied, the r1 r2, r3 are certain rules respectively; because S i  X j  and S i  X j    i=4,5,6  j=1,2,3 are satisfied, the uncertain rules are obtained. Since rule r1 and r2 are the same, number of acquired rules is 5 In terms of definition of rule confidence degree and support degree a i  S i  X j S i   u i  S i  X j U  i=1,2,3,4,5,6  j=1,2,3 the confidence degree and support degree of each rule can be elaborated as follows a 1 1 u 1 0.167 a 2 1 u 2 0.33 a 3 1 u 3  0.167 a 4 0.5 u 4 0.167 a 5 0.33 u 5 0.167 a 6  0.67 u 6 0.33. If and only if acquired rule which satisfies the confidence degree a 015 a 0 and  support degree u 015 u 0 then the rule can be output. Reference the initial a 0 0.5, u 0  0.1 and we select r1, r2, r3, r4, r6 as the output In addition, if a 0  0.3 then r5 and r6 are all selected  because two rules with the same condition attributes have the different decisive attributes, then the composite rule is depicted as follows S, full  d good  d, excellent  a 0.67 u 0.33  The rules obtained from our experiment are the same with those done in w h i c h prov es t h at ou r  method is efficient. What’s more, the confidence degree and support degree we have defined to every rule lend credibility and reliability to the acquired knowledge  6  Conclusion and outlook  In this paper, through the study of the confidence degree and support degree of association rule, the rule confidence degree and support degree in incomplete information system is defined; then a improved discernible matrix is proposed based on the rough set theory. Additionally, a knowledge acquisition algorithm is designed and implemented with the integration of self-adaptive genetic algorithm. Validity experiment has been done towards the algorithm and the results have proved the availability Since incomplete information systems are more complicated than complete information system, further research of knowledge acquisition under different requirements in incomplete information system is needed for future research, and the proposed approach strategy can be extended to more complicated and general information system such as multi-value attributes information system or the incomplete fuzzy information system  7  Acknowledgement  Thanks to the financial support from Natural Science Foundation of China with granted number 60773197 and Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation under granted number Y107750  Reference  1  Pawlak, Z., Rough sets International Journal of Computer and Information Science II\(5\1982, 341-356 2  Cnzymala-Busse, J.

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold. In Fig. 4, there are at least N*cf 2 4*75%=3 columns which have value T \(namely, in the column of C1 there is S1, in the column of C2 there is S1, in the column of C3 there is S2, in the column of C4 there is S5 therefore DCAR5: course\(Cno 003 1  student\(Sno 004 1  study\(Sno, Cno  VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as “for many”, “there are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logic”, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e composition”, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
