Mode choice is a pattern recognition problem, where different human behavior patterns determine the choices among alternative travel modes. Based on the functional similarity between artificial neural networks \(ANN and decision tree, the method of knowledge-based neural networks \(KBNN\ combines the rule induction of decision tree \(DT\ and the accurate approximation of ANN. One appeal of KBNN is the use of pattern association and error correction to represent a problem. This contrasts considerably with the random utility maximization framework in discrete choice modeling. So a network built by this method and a nested logit \(NL\ model are specified, estimated and comparatively evaluated. The prediction results show that KBNN model demonstrates the highest performance The analysis of actual investigation data shows that the proposed KBNN model has fast convergence and high precision, which is of great importance for travel mode choice prediction Key words: travel mode choice; ANN; DT; KBNN; NL  1. Introduction  Travel mode choice has received the most attention among travel behavior analysis, which has a direct impact on the efficiency of travel demand management and traffic control. Since multinomial logit model was developed in the 1970s s c ret e ch oi ce  m odel s  based on random utility maximization have become widely used for mode choice analysis [2-4 d N L  model is the most common tool for eliminating the property of independence of irrelevant alternatives However, the pre-determined mode structure and the linear property of the utility function may not comprehensively represent the complex interrelations among explanatory variable and their effects on the dependent variables Recently, development in artificial intelligence and machine learning has provided new analysis tools for discrete choice modeling. These algorithms model choice behavior without making parametric functional form assumptions but treat discrete choice modeling as a pattern recognition problem, in which multiple complex patterns formed by the combination and interaction of explanatory variables determine the choice decisions among alternatives. Several studies of applying data mining techniques, especially DT [6-8  and ANN [9o r t r av el beh a vi or an al y s i s  demonstrate considerable advantages over traditional NL model by providing insights into pattern characteristics extracted from sample data and from adaptive structures through computational process  2. Artificial neural networks  ANNs are computational paradigms with initial inspirations rooted in biology and physics h e  computational framework for an ANN entails a large number of inter-connected processing elements, called neurons, which for the most part, implement similar and relatively simplistic computational tasks. The true computational power on the other hand derives from a combination of adaptable interconnections, called the weights, a layered topology, and nonlinearities associated with the neuron computations. However recognized challenges of ANN based approach as classifiers or function approximators include the determination of the appropriate number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each hidden layer, the initialization of connection weights, the identification of an appropriate training algorithm among others and

the difficulty in understanding the behavior of  trained neural networks  One way is to extract rules that can be provided to the users [14, 15 T h e i n t e g r at i o n of dom ai n knowledge into ANN provides efficient and reliable forms of neural networks learning. KBNN is such a hybrid intelligent system. It was first provided by Towell as a method to build neural networks according to extracted rules from experiences of expert system or from sample data [16, 17  In this paper, a KBNN is developed for the prediction of commuter travel choice. First, useful attributes and concepts are extracted by DT from the data and linked in a way consistent with initial domain knowledge then the links are weighted properly. The capability and performance on work travel mode choice modeling of the developed KBNN are then compared with the traditional NL model. The data for estimating and evaluating the models are the diary datasets from the Changchun Travel Survey 2003  3. KBNN method  DT model as a supervised learning algorithm uses recursive partitioning to form a tree structure with IFTHEN rules as splitting criteria, each of which is applied with an explanatory variable. Each branch on different levels of the tree represents a subgroup of observations with homogeneity of different degrees Homogeneity increases from top to bottom where the bottom leaves contain the cases of the same group while the top branches offer the roughest split. Each branch from the top node to a bottom leaf node can be described as an IF-THEN rule sequence or rule set There is a corresponding relation between multilayer feed-foreword neural networks and DT \(Table 1 which provides favorable supports for rule extraction by DT model for neural networks learning process. A KNBB on an XOR problem \(Figure 1\hows the procedure of building up the networks with rules extracted by a DT model Table 1   Correspondence between DT and NN DT                                              ANN Internal Nodes                            Input Units Branches                                     Hidden Units Distinct Classes                          Output Units Connections between Nodes       Weighted Connections   2 1 Feature  5  0 3 Feature  3  0 2 Feature   Figure 1   DT of the XOR problem First, the number of input units is preset according to the rule set of the DT model, where each attribute responds to one unit. So here three input units are selected, corresponding to Feature 1 to 3 Then the rules from the decision tree are translated from the original IF A a  B b THEN Class is I to  A-a 0  B-b 0 in which \(A-a\ be considered as a simple hyperplane. Mutually different hyperplanes are obtained from the translated decision rules and the unit number of the first hidden layer is set to the number of hyperplanes. In this XOR problem there are 3 units in the first hidden layer corresponding to the three hyperplanes, Feature1-2 0, Feature2-0.3 0 and Feature3-0.5 0 Next, the unit number of the second hidden layer and the output layer are de termined accord ing to the branches of the decision tree and the number of objective pattern respectively. So for the XOR problem there are four units in the second hidden layer and three output units corresponding to the branches and number of classes Next the networks initialization is guided by two theorems proposed by Towell  Theorem 1: Mapping conjunctive rules into a neural network using  0 pn      2 1  2 P    creates a network that accurately encodes rules given that the rules have a sufficiently small number of antecedents Theorem 2: Mapping disjunctive rules into a neural network using 0 p   2    creates a network that accurately encodes a disjunctive rule given that there are a sufficiently small number of rules p is the weight on links corresponding to positive dependencies n is the weight on links corresponding to negative dependencies P is the number of positive antecedents to the rule, and is a constant to be determined by trial and error For units of the first hidden layer, the weights on links with the input layer are initialized based on the connection relation of extracted hyperplanes, with one represents a connection and zero represents none. The thresholds are set to the constants of the related hyperplanes. Units from the second hidden layer complete conjunction and each corresponds to one decision rule. They are initialized according to theorem 1. The output units finish disjunction and each corresponds to a recognized category. These units are initialized according to theorem 2. Finally important attributes not utilized by the decision tree are selected

guided by professional knowledge and added to the input layer and the hidden layers are also expanded These newly added units and links are often randomly initialized [18 Fig u r e 2 s h o w s th e K N B B f o r th e  XOR problem And after finishing the networks establishment the training process can be carried out based on various ANN training algorithms    2 1 Feature  5  0 3 Feature    Figure 2   KBNN of the XOR problem  4. KBNN implementation  4.1. Data set and sample composition  The data used for implementing the models come from the travel diary data from the Changchun Travel Survey 2003. This study emphasizes the trip to work mode choice. The alternatives for work travel mode choice used in this study include walk, bicycle motorcycle, transit and car. The database was divided randomly into two datasets with 60 percent used for the model estimation and another 40 percent used for the subsequent validation test. The actual mode split of training and test sets are shown in Table 2 Table 2   Summary of mode splits Travel Mode          Training Dataset          Test Dataset Walk \(M1\      884 \(27.85%\               589 \(27.85 Bicycle \(M2\         809 \(25.51%\               540 \(25.51 Motorcycle \(M3\100\(3.16%\                 67 \(3.16 Transit \(M4\     1168 \(36.79%\              778 \(36.79 Car \(M5\             212 \(6.69%\               142 \(6.69 Total                      3173 \(100%\              2116 \(100 The socio-demographic characteristics of traveler and his family, attributes related to transportation systems and the trip to work are all important factors of mode choice. So a total of twelve variables were identified for travel mode choice modeling as defined in Table 3 Table 3   Input variables Variable            Definition xb            0:Woman;1:Man nl             Age of traveler in years, continuous edu          Education level.1:Primary school and below;2:Secondary school;3:High school;4College and university; Graduate and above z h y Type of employment. 1:Unit responsible person;2  professional technical personnel;3:Clerk 4:Business service;5:Agricultural and water conservancy labors;6:Production, transport equipment operators and related workers rjzx          No. of bikes per household member, continuous rjmt   No. of motorcycles per household member continuous rjxq          No. of cars per household member, continuouse tq              No. of commuters in a household ainc          Monthly income per household member in RMB minc         Monthly income of the commuter in RMB gxr            0:Without weekend; 1:With weekend dis             Home to work travel distance in Km Travel mode choice modeling predicts individual’s or certain group’s mode choice decisions and the induced demand for each mode or demand distribution across modes. Two types of prediction rates or match rates are used to evaluate and compare the mode choice modeling performance of different methods. One is individual match rate i r which is the ratio of the number of correctly predicted individual observations for one mode p i N over the total number of the actual observations choosing this mode a N the other is aggregate match rate a r which reflects the prediction accuracy on the mode aggregate level, defined as the ratio of the number of predicted observations for one mode p a N over the number of the actual observations choosing this mode a N They are defined as follows   ipia apaa rNN rNN     4.2. Networks structure  The DT model \(in Figure 3\ied for KBNN is based on the C4.5 algorithm. The C4.5 algorithm generates a DT in two phases, namely construction and pruning. In the construction of a DT model a training data group is divided at each stage subdivision according to an explanatory va riable selected based on the splitting criterion. The division continues until all observations in a subgroup have the same mode choice at the bottom [6-8 T h e t w el v e v a riables  f r o m T a ble 3  are used as input for the KBNN. Based on the procedures for networks setting up, ten mutually different hyperplanes are extracted, namely rjzx-0.5 rjmt-0, rjmt-1, rjxq-0, xb-1, ainc-1000, minc-2500, dis1.5, dis-3, dis-7. The networks have 12 units on the second hidden layer and 5 units as output. It is initialized based on the method provided in the previous section

And this is the best fit version from a series of hierarchical trees. The model is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and the results are summarized in Table 4. Walk mode is chosen as the baseline alternative  Figure 4     NL model structure Table 4   Estimation results of NL training model  Alternative specific constant Estimation t-statistic M2 1.63 7.00 M3 1.05 4.16 M4 1.23 2.38 M5 1.45 3.79 Non-motorized        Inclusive value=0.65, t-statistic=4.22 Factors for M2 dis -0.83 -9.816 ainc -0.0002 -1.742 nl 0.021 1.93 below edu4 0.38 4.15 Factors for M3 rjzx+rjzd+rjxq 1.26 9.75 nl 0.0381 2.74 Motorized                Inclusive value=0.72, t-statistic=3.74 Factors for M4 zhy4 -0.63 -4.41 below edu4 0.30 5.39 gxr -0.19 -4.26 rjzx+rjzd+rjxq -0.26 -2.08 Factors for M5 zhy1 0.75 3.21 edu4 -0.84 -2.18 rjzx+rjzd+rjxq 1.15 2.37 Number of cases=3173 L L 0  5106.74   L L c  3104.25   LL  2093.76    2 LL 0  LL  60 25 96    2 LL c  LL  2 020 98    2 0.59   The comparison of estimation results between KBNN and NL model are demonstrated in Table 5. It is clear that KBNN model outperforms the NL model on both the training and test dataset; NL has worse transferability in that the match rates decrease considerably from the training dataset to the test dataset; the KBNN model is estimated using the standard back propagation algorithm while the NL model is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation method, so in the MNL model the magnitude and sign of the coefficients \(Table 4 indicated the importance and impact of the corresponding variables on mode choice and the value of the t-statistic indicate the confidence level. While the KBNN model shows week interpretability although the importance of explanatory variables can be obtained from sensitivity analysis Table 5   Results of KBNN and NL  Method             Training Accuracy             Test Accuracy 3173\                                \(2116 KBNN              84.5%                                 86.8 NL                    80.2%                                 76.5 For the KBNN model, the estimation results of training dataset and test dataset are shown in Table 6 and Table 7, in which the actual number of observations of each mode are shown in the first column, while the predicted mode choice are shown in the following five columns. From the estimation results it is shown that KBNN offer higher individual prediction accuracy for motorcycle and car in both training and test datasets. But the model can’t predict bike and transit mode very accurately in either the training or the test dataset. Patterns from these two modes are often mismatched mutually. This is very likely due to the fact that walk and bike travel modes share many common attributes such as physical strength depletion, travel distance and time consumption characters and travel cost, which makes the classification very difficult. The same trend also exists in the identification between bike and transit which also shows similarity in travel time and travel distance consumption attributes Table 6   Estimation results of KBNN on training dataset   Predicted Mode Choice r i r a  M1 M2 M3 M4 M5

Discussion and conclusions  With the capacity of learning driven by pattern recognition and effort correction mechanisms, the KBNN method based on the similarity between neural networks and decision tree, which combines the rule extraction and the accurate approximation of these two algorithms was used to construct commuter mode choice model for Shanghai, China. Its capacity for generalization and estimation performance was compared with the classical discrete choice model namely the nested logit model. The research results demonstrated that the KBNN model has fast convergence and high precision, which is of great importance for travel mode choice prediction. The model offers considerable advantages on predictive power and comparatively appeal in transferability from training dataset to test dataset over NL model. The proposed KNBB model performs with its structure flexibility to adapt to the training data and has the capability to produce explainable if-then rules through hyperplanes in the first hidden layer It is found in this research that a behavior rich teaching data is very important to construct and train a KBNN model. And one important property of neural networks models is their capability of processing missing data and noise. So further research should be carried out to find if the KBNN model is able to work well with noise and missing data  6.

with their original undiscretized gene expression values SVM was run with its default radial kernel We ran randomForest 10 times with its default 500 trees for ALL LC and OC and its accuracy was constant For PC we had to increase randomForest's number of trees to 1000 before its accuracy stabilized over the 10 runs Table III contains the number of class 0/1 samples in the clinically determined training set the number of genes selected by our entropy discretization and our experimental results As shown in this table the overall average accuracies of BSTC and RCBT are again best at about 96 each When compared against RCBT SVM and randomForest on the individual tests we can see that BSTC is alone in having 100 accuracy on the majority of datasets However BSTC's performance on the preliminary AML/ALL dataset test is relatively poor This is likely due to over fitting Every error BSTC made mistook a class 0 AML test sample for a class 1 ALL test sample i.e all errors were made in this same direction And the ALL training data has both i about 2.5 times as many class 1 samples as class 0 samples and ii a small number of total samples/genes When the training set is more balanced and the number of samples/genes is larger we can expect that cancellation of errors will tend to neutralize/balance any over fitting effects in BSTC And BSTC is a method meant primarily for large training sets where CAR-mining is prohibitively expensive As we will see below in Section V-B.1 BSTC s performance is much better for larger AML/ALL training set sizes B Holdout Validation Studies Holdout validation studies make comparisons less susceptible to the choice of a single training dataset and provide performance evaluations that are likely to better represent program behavior in practice We next present results from a thorough holdout validation study completed using 100 different training/test sets from each of the ALL LC PC and OC data sets For these holdout validation tests we benchmark BSTC against Top-k/RCBT because i BSTC/RCBT perform hest in our preliminary experiments ii Top-k/RCBT is the fastest/most accurate CAR-based classifier for microarray data and iii we are interested in BSTC's CAR-related vs Topk/RCBT s CAR based scalability For the holdout validation study we generated training sets of sizes 40 60 and 80 of the total samples Each training set was produced by randomly selecting samples from the original combined dataset We then used the standard R dprep package's entropy minimized partition 17 to discretize the selected training samples Finally the remaining dataset samples were used for testing the two classifiers after rule/BST generation on the randomly selected training data For each training set size we produced 25 independent tests In addition to these training sets we created an additional 25 1-x/0-y tests To create these tests we chose training data by randomly selecting x class 1 samples and y class 0 samples to be used as training data As before the remaining samples were then used to test both classifiers For each dataset the x and y values are chosen so that the resulting 25 classification tests have the exact same training/test data proportions as the single related dataset test reported in section V-A For each training set size we plot our results using a boxplot Boxplot Interpretation Each boxplot that we show in this section can be interpreted as follows The median of the measurements is shown as a diamond and a box with boundaries is drawn at the first and the third quartile The range between these two quartiles is called the inter-quartile range IQR Vertical lines a.k.a whiskers are drawn from the box to indicate the minimum and the maximum value unless outliers are present If outliers are presents the whiskers only extend to 1 5 x IRQ The outliers that are near i.e within 3 x IRQ are drawn as an empty circle and further outliers are drawn using an asterisk 1 ALIJAML ALL Experiment Figure 4 shows the classification accuracy for the ALL/AML dataset As can be seen in this figure BSTC and RCBT have similar accuracy across the ALL/AML tests as a whole BSTC outperforms RCBT in terms of median and mean accuracy on the 40 and 80 training set sizes while RCBT has better median/mean accuracy on the 1-27/0-11 training size tests And both classifiers have the same median on the 60 training set size Over the 100 ALL/AML tests we see that BSTC has a mean accuracy of 92.13 while RCBT has a mean accuracy of 91.39 they are very close It's noteworthy that BSTC is 100 accurate on the majority of 80 training size tests However BSTC appears to have slightly higher variance than RCBT on all but the 40 training tests Considering all the results together both BSTC and RCBT have essentially equivalent classification accuracies on the ALL/AML dataset 2 Lung Cancer LC Experiment The results for the Lung Cancer dataset are reported in Figure 5 Here again both BSTC and RCBT have similar classification behavior RCBT has higher mean and median accuracies on the 40 and 60 tests while BSTC outperforms RCBT on the 1-16/0-16 tests Meanwhile both classifier have the same median on the 80 training test Over all 100 LC tests we find that BSTC has a mean accuracy of 96 32 while RCBT has a mean accuracy of 97.08 again they are very close As before BSTC is alone in having 100

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
