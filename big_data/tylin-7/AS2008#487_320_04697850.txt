I I NTRODUCTION Advances in wireless technologies vehicular ad hoc and sensor networks and micro-electronic devices have led to the development of sensor nodes that are capable of sens 
ing processing and transmitting data Sensor nodes are deployed in a certain geographical area with the main functions of sensing the surrounding environment and sending the generated data to a central node called the Sink for further processing and analysis In order to guarantee an acceptable level of quality for events\222 delivery for vehicular ad hoc and sensor networks class of applications for instance a new class of fast reliable and fault tolerant protocols for WSN need to be developed However the distributed nature and the limited resources of sensor nodes e.g energy communication and computation 14 as well as the unreliability of wireless communication increase the possibility of errors lost messages delays in data delivery and losses of functionality These factors are potentially devastating to the performance and the overall Quality of Service QoS of WSNs Recently

major impacts of Sensor Association Rules that bene\036t many applications are the ability of predicting the sources of future events and the ability of identifying the sets of temporally correlated sensors In order to prepare the data needed for generating Sensor Association Rules each sensor node should monitor its activity over time and inform the Sink about the time slots in which events were detected time is assumed to be divided into equalsized slots The set of time slot numbers in which the sensor has detected events within a given historical period is referred to as the Activity Set of the sensor node Sensor rules discover the correlation between all sensor nodes in the wireless sensor network regardless of their locations However in most applications a speci\036c location may be covered by many sensors Moreover a k-coverage

and corruption of messages while they being routed from sensor nodes to the Sink Sensor readings are stream in nature so applying an association mining algorithm like Apriori directly to the stream of data is not possible This situation led authors to propose the Data Stream Association Rule Mining DSARM framework that transforms the Apriori algorithm  to mak e it applicable to the data s tream recei v ed from sensor nodes In the authors proposed Sensor Association Rules as an attempt to capture the temporal correlation between sensor nodes in a particular Wireless Sensor Network WSN The main difference of this approach from others is that the sensors themselves happen to be the main objects in the extracted rules not the sensors\222 readings In order to prepare the data needed for generating Sensor Association Rules each sensor node should monitor its activity over time and inform the Sink about the time slots in which events were detected This data is referred to by Sensor data activities It is important to note that the data activities is meta-data that describes sensor behaviors which differs from data reported by the sensor about the surrounding environment i.e sensors\222 readings Sensor data activities can be collected using existing routing protocols or using one of several data gathering algorithms However none of these algorithms is designed to collect data for mining purpose and they do not consider the redundance existing between sensors\222 data activity These factors force the need for special data collecting techniques for mining purpose In

Mining is an essential step in the knowledge discovery process that is concerned with extracting hidden knowledge from vast amounts of data using techniques inspired by different disciplines such as databases machine learning arti\036cial inelegant and statistics Recently  data mining techniques have been used to extract patterns regarding sensor data These kind of patterns is usually used to gain insight about the phenomena under monitoring These patterns can be also used to improve the performance of the network Association Rules algorithm is among the 036rst data mining techniques that has been used to extract patterns from WSNs Association Rules was 036rst introduced by Argawal  studies the problem of mining associations between sensors\222 values in data streams generated from sensor nodes in a particular wireless sensor network Their technique depends on a data model that stores data reported from sensor nodes and presenting it in a way that facilitates the adaption of loosy counting algorithm that mak es one pass analysis of the data In this data model sensors are assumed to take values from a 036nite discrete number of values A quantization method is applied for the continuous values The time is divided into equal-sized intervals and snapshots from the sensors\222 readings are taken whenever there is change to these readings These snapshots are stored in a database in the form of contexts Mining spatial temporal event patterns is another attempt to link the problem of mining sensor data to the association mining problem proposed by Kay R 250 omer R 250 omer\222s approach took into consideration the distributed nature of wireless sensor networks and proposed an in-network data mining technique to discover the frequent patterns of events with certain spatial and temporal properties In this approach each sensor node is aware of the events that are within a certain distance from itself this distance may be a Euclidean distance or number of hops The sensor then collects these events and applies a mining algorithm to discover the pattern that satis\036es a given parameters R 250 omer\222s mining parameters approach includes minimum support  Each

data is transferred to the Sink without any processing by the sensor node ii Distributed Extraction this mechanism is designed to put more computational load on the sensor nodes by equipping each sensor with additional storage space to store behavioral data in the historical period Attaching a storage device to each sensor was previously impossible due to the high energy consumption caused by maintaining the storage device However recent advances in 037ash memory technology have changed this perspective and studies have shown that energy consumption for maintaining a unit of data within a 037ash memory coupled with a sensor node is very low compared to the energy needed for transmitting that unit In the authors reported that a 037ash memory lik e NANAD from Toshiba storing 28GB of data generated at a rate of 512 bytes per second will decrease the life time of a sensor node designed to run for three years by only six weeks iii In-Network Reduction in this mechanism the number of

Association Rules An interesting application for Coverage-based Rules sees them predict the location of moving objects For example consider the network in Figure 1 this network is designed for detecting moving vehicles and reporting their locations to the Sink Assuming that the Sink possesses a coverage rule that stipulates E,B  In this case the Sink can inform the application about the next expected location of the moving object a piece of information that proves helpful in many situations Generating Coverage-based Rules involve preparing the database that consists of a set of locations in the wireless sensor network and their activity sets The key for preparing this database is to partition the network into a set of locations and to identify the set of sensor nodes that cover each location However for the simulation purpose we will use a 036xed partitioning made by the Sink Recall that we are not proposing a new coverage-based clustering algorithm as it is out of the scope of this paper and requires a deep analysis of its ef\036ciency We are going to provide a basic clustering scheme based on the sensing coverage of the sensor nodes in order This full text paper

Coveragebased Rules requires fewer messages to extract data than the All-rules scheme in numbers and for the given simulation parameters Coverage-based Rules requires 7%-10 of the number of messages needed for preparing the behavioral data needed for All-rules This percentage however depends on the coverage property of the network The higher the degree of clustering the fewer is the volume of data to be routed to the Sink In the worst case k  1 the number of messages for the Coverage-based Rules will be equal to that needed to prepare the data for the All-rules scheme in addition to a few number of control messages needed in the attempt for clustering the network If Coverage-based Rules is built on top of an already coverage-based clustering algorithm then this number can be neglected Another interesting metric about network performance during the process of preparing the data for All-rules and Coverage-based Rules is the average energy consumption per node We considered two main sources for energy consumption that needed for maintaining the buffer storage at each node i.e the energy consumption for read write and erase a buffer entry and the energy exhausted by message

comparison analysis for the performance of wireless sensor networks during the data preparation process for Coverage-based and Sensor Association Rules schemes For simplicity we will refer to the scheme that generates the association rules between all the sensor nodes as the 224All-rules scheme.\224 The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the network are the number of messages needed to report the activity sets to the Sink and the average energy consumptions per sensor node The metrics are collected based on a simulator that has been built using Matlab version 7.4.0.287 The nodes are assumed to be deplo yed in a grid environment with a distance of 8 meters between sensor nodes and a sensing range up to 16 meters Events generation by each sensor node is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the possible number of epochs Sensor nodes covering the same area have the same activity sets Although Coverage-based Rules can be implemented on top of any of the coverage-based clustering algorithms like those introduced in 3 we ha v e implemented it on top of 036x ed network partitions where the location managers have been decided by the Sink node based on the network topology The number of location mangers depends on the sensing range and the density of the network If the network is dense enough and the nodes have long sensing range then the number of partitions is equal to N/k where N is the number of sensors in the network and k is the required coverage property In reality however we may have more than this number as it is hard to guarantee full k-coverage networks especially at the borders of the network T o cluster the netw ork we assume that all the nodes have the same sensing range R and transmission rang T where is the energy consumption for the

values of 0 50 and 90 respectively All 036gures show that the energy consumption per node for the Coverage-based Rules is less than the average energy consumption using the All-rules scheme in Coverage-based Rules each node requires anywhere between 50 to 55 of the energy exhausted by a node in the All-rules scheme The percentages will vary if the number of messages changed However there is extra energy consumption to be accounted for in case of Coverage-based Rules due to the transmission of activity sets from sensor nodes to the location manager V C ONCLUSION Coverage-based Association Rules is the Knowledge Discovery technique designed speci\036cally for wireless networks that guarantees a k-coverage property for the network In contrast to Sensor Association Rules Coverage-based Rules discovers the correlation between the set of locations in the network instead of the correlation between all nodes The activity set of each location is prepared from the activity sets of the sensor nodes covering the area In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme we have presented several set of experiments Our results indicate clearly that our proposed coverage-based Rules require about 7%-10 of the number of messages used by the All-rules scheme as discussed earlier in Section 4 and in terms of average energy consumption we have observed that each sensor node in our coverage-based Rules scheme requires about 50-55 of the energy exhausted by a node in the All-rules scheme R EFERENCES  B ouk erche A and S amarah S  A No v el Algorithm for M ining Association

association mining The Likelihood Ratio Test fails to extract features also belonging to common vocabulary and it makes the extraction dependent on the feature position in the sentence leading to low recall The dBNP and bBNP based methods yield low recall due to the fact that the product features do not occur with the article the in front of them very often The Association Mining approach returns all frequent nouns which decreases precision Our results suggest that the choice of algorithm to use depends on the targeted dataset If it consists of mainly on-topic content the results of Table 10 indicate that the Association Mining algorithm is better suited for this task due to its high recall If the dataset consists of a mixture of onand off-topic content our results suggest that the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm would perform better due to its ability to distinguish and 002lter out the off-topic features For future work we plan to extend the Likelihood Ratio Test methods especially the dBNP based approach by other determiners such as a or this  which should increase the recall of this method Another possibility which we will investigate regards the BNP patterns The current Likelihood Ratio Test approach is not capable of dealing with discontinuous feature phrases for example in 5 the quality of the pictures is great the feature would be picture quality  This problem could be addressed by introducing wildcards in the BNP patterns We will also investigate whether there are any methods in order to calculate an optimal threshold for the candidate feature extraction in order to increase the recall of the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm We plan to investigate whether a deeper linguistic analysis e.g with a dependency parser can improve the feature

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821–830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 43–52 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713–716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546–552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117–132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284–295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
