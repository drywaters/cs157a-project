The Fault Diagnosis Algorithm for Transformer Based on Extenics and Rough Set Theory  SHU Hong-chun HU Ze-jiang SUN Shi-yun YANG Qing   AbstractAs one of the most important equipments to guarantee power gird operating safely and stably, the fault diagnosis of transformer has most important sense. Since the general diagnosis methods such as DGA and attributes\222 reduction of rough set haven\222t enough precision for transformer\222s fault diagnosis  Extenics and rough set theory are brought into diagnosing the fault of transformer. Using attribute predigesting method in rough set theory to classify the attribute term which needed by each fault diagnosis. Then building matter element model for 
transformer\222s fault diagnosis. Using DGA testing datum to be attribute set and the transformer\222s standard fault model to be the decision set for transformer\222s fault diagnosis. Utilize association function from Extenics to count each fault degree Define the fault accepting rule to get transformer\222s fault. Use this method to diagnose one fault transformer and the diagnosis result matched case of fact fault. Apply this method to diagnose 76 DGA testing data and the right ratio of diagnostic result is better than IEC method Keywords Transformer Fault Diagnosis Extenics Matter Element Model Rough Set INTRODUCTION HE transformer is the most important equipment in 
power system and if it\222s fault, the loss of economic for power system will be very huge. So that operation of transformer is the important factor in reliability of system. The fault diagnosis of transformer for system is always as important scientific research program neither in china nor outside. Now there have so many method to diagnose the fault of transformer, such as DGA method 1-2 But the information of DGA method isn\222t enough to diagnose all of the faults for transformer, and there brings many methods which combined with DGA information such as probability ratiocination, judgment tree, information fuse, Petri network and so on 3-7 But there always have so much uncalled-for information in the test data, and it may lead research people give out a 
wrong fault diagnosis result. As this situation, this paper gives out a method which based on matter element Financial support: Project Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China 90610024 50467002 50347026 Yunnan Science and Technology Project 2003GG10 Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan 2005F0005Z 2004E0020M 2002E0025M  SHU Hong-chun is with Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650051, Yunnan, China. \(Email: kmshc@sina.com HU Ze-jiang is with Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650051, Yunnan, China  SUN Shi-yun is with Kunming University of Science and Technology 
Kunming 650051, Yunnan, China YANG Qing is with Yunnan Power Gird Corporation, Kunming 650051, Yunnan, China model and combined with rough set. Use the attribute predigestion method in rough set to predigest the information form test data first, and then build a matter element model by Extenics, use association function of Extenics to calculate the severity of fault, define a rule to assure the fault types of transformer. After use this method the difficulty of diagnosis will be debased and the speed of diagnosis will be enhanced  PRINCIPIUM AND FORMULA A. The principle of Diagnosis with Extenics and Rough Set Use DGA data to diagnose the fault of transformer is a important research direction in power system, but 
when in real application there have a problem of that non-code problem happened in the situation of using IEC three-ratio method to diagnose the transformer. This paper use Extenics to diagnose the fault can avoid the non-code problem Before the diagnosis, there have so many test data and the fault type of transformer is so many, the data is not corresponding to all the faults and we should predigest it. In this paper we use attribute predigestion method 8 to predigest it. After predigesting the capacity of data will reduce and will not to affect the diagnosis because the core of attributions have been hold in the data. This method will speed up the diagnosis speed and may avoid the wrong diagnosis 
After the attribute predigestion, we build a matter element model for transformer using the attributions use the capacity of gases which are prescribed in paper[1 u s e I E C t h re e rat i o  m e t h o d t o rat i o c i n a t e t h e capacity of each gas, consult the range of capacity to each gases from other papers, then assure the classical field with matter element model, use association function to calculate the severity of fault then assure the fault type of transformer B. The Attribute Predigestion Method of Rough Set Use the difference of reliant degree or the division of equivalence relation to B and B\222  B is the initial attribution set and B\222 is the subset of B 
which was educed from the total attribution set D         D r D r D k B B B 
212 212  1        D pos D pos D n B B B 
212  2 Suppose that the attribution table is as Table.1, use formula\(4\ and \(5\ to predigest the attribution, and then calculate the k 1  D and k 2  D to form new tables of T

Brief Introduction of Extenics Extenics use matter element model to describe the research object, and use matter element extension matter element exchange and other methods to deal with the problems and to get optimization result If there is a matter N the value of its character C is v and the matter model is as follow v 3 If the matter N has not only one character, we describe all the characters in the model 002  6 And if 1, we thought the T is the reduction change to R 0 if 1, T is the enlarge change D. The Diagnosis to Transformer The diagnosis process is as follow 1\uppose N is the fault matter, if N has fault I i  we notes it I i  N  i 1,2,\205 N and the fault character element set is as follow   8 003 003 then        ij ij ij ij ij V V v v K 003  16 Where  n n v C v C v C N R 2 2 1 1 4 Define D is the domain K mapped to U from Real Range, and the set of Extennics from domain U is          u k y U u y u A   ij ij ij b a V  9   ij ij ij b a V     10 Where V ij is the classic domain when I i  N appened 9  V\222 ij is the section domain when I i  N appened a ij and b ij is the upper limit and minimum limit to C ij  when I i  N appened a\222 ij and b\222 ij is the extension upper limit and minimum limit to C ij when I i  N happened 2\ Build the possible set of matter element to describe matter N     7   2  1     N i V C M ij ij ij  001  5 Generally the matter element is as 0 0 0 v 0  0 0 R TR  i i ik ik i i i ij V C V C N I R 1 1    i=1,2,\205N 11 3\ Build the actuality set of matter element to describe matter N   i i ik ik i i i v C v C N I R 1 1    i=1,2,\205N 12 4\uild y ij  X n from V ij  and M ij Use the attribution predigest method to form a new table of Y 222 ij  n  5\ Take the attribution of Y 222 ij  n nto R ij and then form a new matter model of R\222 ij   i i in in i i i ij V C V C N I R 1 1     i=1,2,\205N 13 And get a new R\222 in the same way  i i in in i i i v C v C N I R 1 1     i=1,2,\205N 14 6\ Calculate the value of association function             ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij V v V v V v v K

Consult paper[8-1  a n d  t h e t e st d a t a  in year 2004 to 2006, build the primary fault set and decision set as Table.2 Use the predigestion method of upper in rough set to predigest the attribution and then the result is as Table.3 According to Guide for the analysis and diagnosis of gases dissolved in transformer oil[S  when the content of hydrocarbon over 150\265L L or content of C 2 H 2 over 5\265L L or content of H 2 over 150\265L L, should notice the transformer\222s situation and analyze its health. This paper use content of C 2 H 2 to be the standard value and get the other contents of gases by IEC three-ratio method 1,9,12 Use the upper method of diagnosis to diagnose the transformer in case study, and the result is as Table.4 Table.2 primary fault set and decision set attribution set decision set number gases test data in 2006 test data in 2005 test data in 2004 number fault type primary diagnose 1 CH 4 83.79 14.56 35.69 1 normal normal 2 C 2 H 2 162.68 0 0 2 low temperature 3 C 2 H 4 112.08 2.07 1.89 3 middle temperature 4 C 2 H 6 10.65 0.77 6.41 4 high temperature overheating 5 H 2 441.07 11.65 54.54 5 low energy 6 CO 2 1499.35 1282.93 2882.6 6 high energy discharge 7 CO 766.11 438.05 1272.48 7 low energy discharge and overheating 8 content of  hydrocarbon 369.2 17.4 43.99 8 high energy discharge and overheating overheating and  discharge Table.3 the result of predigestion to decision set primary diagnose relative attribution primary diagnose relative attribution primary diagnose relative attribution C 2 H 2 CH 4 CH 4  C 2 H 4 H 2 H 2  C 2 H 6 C 2 H 2 C 2 H 2  C 2 H 4  CO 2  overheating  discharge  overheating and  discharge CO The result compared to IEC result, the 2006 years\222 result is different to IEC result. The IEC result is type 6, the Extenci result is type 8, but the test and examine result is fault 8 in 2006 years of the actual test. We can see that the Extenics result is right. For proving the rightness of Extenics, get 76 DGA data and applied the method, IEC three-ratio method and paper[9  me t h o d to d iag n o s e  transformer, the result is as Table.5  212 212  212  003 17 7\ssure the coefficient Suppose the fault of Y 1 if we get m stylebook of the fault of Y 1 there have s j stylebook which leaded by attribution X j So the first coefficient is as  m s j j   i n j j j j j j 1

4 Itemsets and Decision Trees So far we have discussed how to transmit binary data by using decision trees In this section we present how to selec t the itemsets representing the dependencies implied by the decision trees We will use this link in Section 5 A similar link between itemsets and decision trees is explored in 27 although our setup and goals are different Given a leaf L  the dependency of the item a t is captured in the coding table of L  Hence we are interested in 002nding itemsets that carry the same information That is itemsets from which we can compute the coding table To derive the codes for the leaf L it is suf\002cient to compute the probability q D  a t  1 j L   q D  a t  1  L  q D  L   1 Our goal is to express the probabilities on the right side of the equation using itemsets In order to do that let P be the path from L to its root Let pos  L  be the items along the path P which are tested positive Similarly let neg  L  be the attributes which are tested negative Using the inclusion-exclusion principle we see that q D  L   q D  pos  L   1  neg  L   0  X V 022 neg  L   000 1 j V j f r  pos  L   V   2 We compute q D  a t  1  L  in a similar fashion Let us de\002ne sets  L  for a given leaf L to be sets  L   f V  pos  L  j V 022 neg  L  g  f V  pos  L   f a t g j V 022 neg  L  g  Combining Eqs 1–2 we see that the collection sets  L  satis\002es our goal Proposition 6 The coding table associated with the leaf L can be computed from the frequencies of sets  L   Example 7 Let L 1  L 2  and L 3 be the leaves from left to right of T 4 in Figure 1\(d Then the corresponding families of itemsets are sets  L 1   f a ac g  sets  L 2   f b ab bc abc g  and sets  L 3   f  a b ab c ac bc abc g  We can easily see that the family sets  L  is essentially the smallest family of itemsets from which the coding table can be derived uniquely Proposition 8 Let G 6  sets  L  be a family of itemsets Then there are two data sets say D 1 and D 2  for which q D 1  a t  1 j L  6  q D 2  a t  1 j L  but f r  G  D 1   f r  G  D 2   Given a tree T we de\002ne sets  T  to be sets  T   S L 2 lvs  T  sets  L   We also de\002ne sets  T   S i sets  T i  where T  f T 1      T K g is a decision tree model 5 Choosing Good Itemsets The connection between itemsets and decision trees made in the previous section allows us to consider an orthogonal approach to identify good itemsets Informally our goal is to construct decision trees from a family of itemsets F  selecting the subset from F that provides the best compression of the data More formally our new approach is as follows given a downward closed family of itemsets F  we build a decision tree model T  f T 1      T K g providing a good compression of the data with sets  T  022 F  Before we can describe our main algorithm we need to introduce some further notation Firstly given two trees T p and T n not using attribute c  we de\002ne J OIN T REE  c T p  T n  to be the join tree with c as the root node T p as the positive branch of c  and T n as the negative branch of c  Secondly to de\002ne our search algorithm we need to 002nd the best tree bt  a t  S F   arg min T f c  T  j t  T   a t  src  T  022 S sets  T  022 F g  that is bt  a t  S F   returns the best tree for a t for which the related sets are in F and only splits on attributes in S  To compute the optimal tree bt  a t  S F   we use the exhaustive method presented originally in 27  g i v e n i n A l gorithm 2 The algorithm is straightforward it tests each valid item as the root and recurses itself on both branches Algorithm 2 G ENERATE algorithm for calculating bt  a t  S F   that is the best tree T for a t using only S as source and having sets  T  022 F  1 B  S   S F   2 C  T RIVIAL T REE  a t   3 for b 2 B do 4 G  f X 000 b j b 2 X 2 F g  5  D p  D n   S PLIT  D b   6 T p  G ENERATE  a t  G  S D p   7 T n  G ENERATE  a t  G  S D n   8 C  C  J OIN T REE  b T p  T n   9 end for 10 return arg min T f c  T  j T 2 Cg  We can now describe the actual algorithm for constructing decision tree models with a low cost Our method automatically discovers the order in which the attributes can be transmitted most succinct For this it needs to 002nd sets of attributes S i for each attribute a i such that these should be encoded before a i  The collection S  f S 1      S K g should de\002ne an acyclic graph and the actual trees are bt  a i  S i  F   We use c  S  as a shorthand for the total complexity P i c  bt  a i  S i  F  of the best model built from S

We construct the set S iteratively At the beginning of the algorithm we have S i   and we increase the sets S i one attribute at a time We allow ourselves to mark the attributes The idea is that once the attribute a i is marked then we are not allowed to augment S i any longer At the beginning none of the nodes are marked To describe a single step in the algorithm we consider a graph H   v 0      v K   where v 1      v K represent the attributes and v 0 is a special auxiliary node We start by adding edges  v i  v 0  having the weight c  bt  a i  S i  F   thus the cost of the best tree possible from F using only the attributes in S i  Then for each unmarked node v i we 002nd out what other extra attribute will help most to encode it succinct To do this we add the edge  v i  v j  for each v j with the weight c  bt  a i  S i  f a j g  F   Now let U be the minimum directed spanning tree of H having v 0 as the sink Consider an unmarked node v i such that  v i  v 0  2 E  U   That node is now the best choice to be 002xed as it helps to encode the data best We therefore mark attribute a i and add a i to each S j for each ancestor v j of v i in U  This process is repeated until all attributes are marked The details of t he algorithm are given in Algorithm 3 Algorithm 3 The algorithm S ET P ACK constructs a decision tree model T given a family of itemsets F such that sets  T  022 F  Returns a DAG a family S   S 1      S K  of sets of attributes The trees are T i  bt  a i  S i  F   1 S   S 1      S K             2 r   r 1      r K    false      false   3 V  f v 0      v K g  4 while there exists r i  false do 5 E    6 for i  1      K do 7 E  E   v i  v 0   8 w  v i  v 0   c  bt  a i  S i  F   9 if r i  false then 10 for j  1      K do 11 T  bt  a i  S i  f a j g  F   12 if c  T  024 w  v i  v 0  then 13 E  E   v i  v j   w  v i  v j   c  T   14 end if 15 end for 16 end if 17 end for 18 U  dmst  V E  f Directed Min Spanning Tree g 19 for  v i  v 0  2 E  U  and r i  false do 20 r i  true  21 for v j is a parent of v i in U do 22 S j  S j  a i  23 end for 24 end for 25 end while 26 return S  The marking of the attributes guarantees that there can be no cycles in S  In fact the marking order also tells us a valid order for transmitting the attributes Further as at least one attribute is marked at each step this guarantees that th e algorithm terminates in K steps Let S be the collection of sources The following proposition tells us that the augmentation performed by S ET P ACK does not compromise the optimality of collections next to S  Proposition 9 Assume the collection of sources S  f S 1      S K g  Let O  f O 1      O K g be the collection of sources such that S i 022 O i and j O i j 024 j S i j  1  Let S 0 be the collection that Algorithm 3 produces from S in a single step Then there is a collection S 003 such that S 0 i 022 S 003 i and that c  S 003  024 c  O   Proof Let G be the graph constructed by Algorithm 3 for the collection S  Construct the following graph W  For each O i such that O i  S i add the edge  v i  v 0   For each O i 6  S i add the edge  v i  v j   where f a j g  O i 000 S i  But W is a directed spanning tree of G  Let U be the directed minimum spanning tree returned by the algorithm Let S 003 i  S 0 i if  v i  v 0  2 E  U  and S 003 i  S 0 i  f a j g if  v i  v j  2 E  U   Note that S 003 de\002nes a valid model and because U is optimal we must have c  S 003  024 c  O   Corollary 10 Assume that F is a family of itemsets having 2 items at maximum The algorithm S ET P ACK returns the optimal tree model Let us consider the complexity of the algorithms The algorithm S ET P ACK runs in a polynomial time By using dynamic programming we can show that G ENERATE runs in O  j F j 2  time We also tested a faster variant of the algorithm in which the exhaustive search in G ENERATE is replaced by the greedy approach similar to the ID3 algorithm We call this variant S ET P ACK G REEDY  6 Related Work Finding interesting itemsets is a major research theme in data mining To this end many measures have been suggested over time A classic measure for ranking itemsets is frequency for which there exist ef\002cient search algorithms 2 15  O t h e r m e a s u r e s i n v o l v e c o m p a r i n g h o w much an itemset deviates from the independence assumption 1,3,4,11  I n y e t o t h e r a p p r o a c h e s m o r e 003 e x i b l e m o d els are used such as Bayes networks 17 18  M a x i m u m Entropy estimates 24 31  R e l a t e d a r e a l s o l o w e n t r o p y sets itemsets for which the entropy of the data is low 16  Many of these approaches suffer from the fact that they require a user-de\002ned threshold and further that at low thresholds extremely many itemsets are returned many of which convey the same information To address the latter

problem we can use closed 28 o r n o n d e r i v a b l e  6  i t e m sets that provide a concise representation of the original itemsets However these methods deteriorate even under small amounts of

the items that are present in the dataset On the other hand we consider the 0 s and the 1 s in the data symmetrically and hence we are able to provide more detailed descriptions of the data including patterns betwee n the presence and absence of items More different from our methods are the lossy data description approaches These strive to describe just part of the data and as such may overlook important interactions Summarization 7 i s a c o m p r e s s i o n a p p r o a c h t h a t i d e n t i 002 e s a group of itemsets such that each transaction is summarized by one set with as little

consider larger pattern sets However it also requires the user to choose a quality measure to which the pattern set has to be optimized unlike our parameterfree and lossless method Alternatively we can view the approach in this paper as building a global model for data and then selecting the itemsets that describe the model This approach then allows us to use MDL as a model selection technique In a related work 32 t h e a u t h o r s b u i l d d e c o m p o s a b l e m o d e l s i n o r d e r to select a small family of itemsets that model the data well The decision trees returned by our methods and particularly the DAG that they form have a passing resemblance to Bayes networks 9  H o w e v e r  a s b o t h t h e m o d e l c o n struction and complexity weighing differ strongly so do th e outcomes To be more precise in our case the distributions p  x par  x  are modeled and weighted via decision trees whereas in the Bayes network setup any distribution is weighted equally Furthermore we use the correspondence between the itemsets and the decision trees to output local patterns as opposed to Bayes networks which are traditionally used as global models 7 Experiments This section contains the results of the empirical evaluation of our methods using toy and real datasets 7.1 Datasets For the experimental validation of the two packing strategies we use a group of datasets with strongly differing stati stics From the LUCS/KDD repository 8 w e t o o k a n u m b e r of often used databases to allow for comparison to other methods To test our methods on real data we used the Mammals presence database and the Helsinki CS-courses dataset The latter contains the enrollment records of students taking courses at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Helsinki The mammals dataset consists of the absence/presence of European mammals 25 in geographical areas of 50x50 kilometers 1 The details of these datasets are provided in Table 1 Table 1

arti\002cial datasets of 2000 transactions and 10 items For both databases the data is generated per transaction and the presence of the 002rst item is based on a fair coin toss For the 002rst database the other items are similarly generated However for the second database the presence of an item is 90 dependent on the previous item As such both datasets have item densities of about 50 If we apply G REEDY P ACK  our greedy decision tree building method to these datasets we see that it is unable to compress the independent database at all Opposing the dependently generated dataset can be compressed into only 1 The full version of the dataset is available for research pur poses upon request http://www.european-mammals.org
