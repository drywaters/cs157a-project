Finding Good Itemsets by Packing Data Nikolaj Tatti HIIT Department of Information and Computer Science Helsinki University of Technology ntatti@cc.hut.\002 Jilles Vreeken Department of Computer Science Universiteit Utrecht jillesv@cs.uu.nl Abstract The problem of selecting small groups of itemsets that represent the data well has recently gained a lot of attention We approach the problem by searching for the itemsets that compress the data ef\002ciently As a compression technique we use decision trees combined with a re\002ned version of MDL More formally assuming that the items are ordered we create a decision tree for each item that may only depend on the previous items Our approach allows us to 002nd complex interactions between the attributes not just co-occurrences of 1s Further we present a link between the itemsets and the decision trees and use this link to export the itemsets from the decision trees In this paper we present two algorithms The 002rst one is a simple greedy approach that builds a family of itemsets directly from data  The second one given a collection of candidate itemsets se lects a small subset of these itemsets Our experiments show that these approaches result in compact and high quality descriptions of the data 1 Introduction One of the major topics in data mining research is the discovery of interesting patterns in data From the introdu ction of frequent itemset mining and association rules 2  the pattern explosion was acknowledged at high frequency thresholds only common knowledge is revealed while at low thresholds prohibitively many patterns are returned Part of this problem can be solved by reducing these collections either lossless or lossy however even then the resulting collections are often so large that they cannot be an alyzed by hand or even machine Recently it was therefore argued 14 t h a t w h i l e t h e e f 002 c i e n c y o f t h e s e a r c h p r o c e s s has received ample attention there still exists a strong ne ed for pattern mining approaches that deliver compact yet hig h quality collections of patterns see Section 6 for a more detailed discussion Our goal is to identify the family of itemsets that form the best description of the data Recent proposals to this end all consider just part of the data by ei ther only considering co-occurrences 30 o r b e i n g l o s s y i n nature 5 7 20  I n t h i s p a p e r  w e p r e s e n t t w o m e t h o d s t h a t do describe all interactions in the data Although differen t in approach both methods return small families of itemsets  which are selected to provide high-quality lossless descri ptions of the data in terms of local patterns Importantly ou r parameterless methods regard the data symmetrically That is we consider not just the 1s in the data but also the 0s Therefore we are able to 002nd patterns that describe all interactions between items in the data not just co-occurrences As a measure of quality for the collection of itemsets we employ the practical variant of Kolmogorov Complexity 23  t h e M i n i m u m D e s c r i p t i o n L e n g t h  M D L  p r i n c i ple 13  T h i s p r i n c i p l e i m p l i e s t h a t w e s h o u l d d o i n d u c t i o n through compression It states that the best model is the model that provides the best compression of the data it is the model that captures best the regularities of the data wi th as little redundancy as possible The main idea of our approach is to use decision trees to determine the shortest possible encoding of an attribute  by using the values of already transmitted attributes For example let us assume two binary attributes A and B  Now say that for 90 of the time when the attribute A has a value of 1  the attribute B has a value of 0  If this situation occurs frequently we recognize this dependency and include the item A in the tree deciding how to encode B  Using such trees allows us to 002nd complex interactions between the items while at the same time MDL provides us with a parameter-free framework for removing fake interactions that are due to the noise in the data The main outcome of our methods is not the decision trees but the group of itemsets that form their paths these are the impor

tant patterns in the data since they capture the dependencie s between the attributes implied by the decision trees The two algorithms we introduce to this end are orthogonal in approach Our 002rst method builds the encoding decision trees directly from the data it greedily introduces sp lits until no split can help to compress the data further Just as naturally as we can extract itemsets from these trees we can consider the trees that can be built from a collection of item sets That link is exploited by our second method which tries to select the best itemsets from a larger collection Experimental evaluation shows that both methods return small collections of itemsets that provide high quality dat a descriptions These sets allow for very short encoding of the data which inherently shows that the most important patterns in the data are captured As the number of itemsets are small we can easily expose the resulting itemsets to further analysis either by hand or by machine The rest of this paper is as follows After the covering preliminaries in Section 2 we discuss how to use decision trees to optimally encode the data succinct in Section 3 Next in Section 4 we explain the connection between decision trees and itemsets Section 5 introduces our method with which good itemsets can be selected by weighing these through our decision tree encoding Related work is discussed in Section 6 after which we present the experiments on our methods in Section 7 We round up with discussion and conclusions in Sections 8 and 9 2 Preliminaries and Notation In this section we introduce preliminaries and notations used in subsequent sections A binary dataset D is a collection of j D j transactions  binary vectors of length K  The i th element of a random transaction is represented by an attribute a i  a Bernoulli random variable We denote the collection of all the attributes by A  f a 1      a K g  An itemset X  f x 1      x L g 022 A is a subset of attributes We will often use the dense notatio n X  x 1 001 001 001 x L  Given an itemset X and a binary vector v of length L  we use the notation p  X  v  to express the probability of p  x 1  v 1      x L  v L   If v contains only 1s then we will use the notation p  X  1  if v contains only 0s then we will use the notation p  X  0  Given a binary dataset D we de\002ne q D to be an empirical distribution  q D  A  v   jf t 2 D j t  v gj  j D j  We de\002ne the frequency of an itemset X to be f r  X   q D  X  1  In the paper we use the common convention 0 log 0  0  All logarithms in the paper are of base 2  In the subsequent sections we will need some knowledge of graphs All the graphs in the paper are directed Given a graph G we denote by V  G  the set of vertices and by E  G  the edges of G  A directed graph is said to be acyclic DAG if there is no cycle in the graph A directed graph is said to be directed spanning tree if each node except one special node has exactly one outgoing edge The special node has no outgoing edge and is called sink  3 Packing Binary Data with Decision Trees In this section we present our model for packing the data and a greedy algorithm for searching good models 3.1 The De\014nition of the Model Our goal in this section is to de\002ne a model that is used to transmit a binary dataset D from a transmitter to a receiver We do this by transmitting one transaction at the time the order of which does not matter Within a single transaction we transmit the items one at the time Assume that we are transmitting an attribute a t  As the attribute may have two values we need to have two codes to indicate its value We de\002ne the table in which these two codes are stored to be a coding table  Obviously the codes need to be optimal that is as short as possible From information theory 10  w e h a v e t h e o p t i m a l S h a n n o n c o d e s o f length 000 log p  x   Here the optimal code lengths are thus 000 log q D  a t  1 and 000 log q D  a t  0  We need to transmit the attribute j D j times The cost of these transmissions is 000j D j X v  f 0  1 g q D  a t  v  log q D  a t  v   This is the simplest case of encoding a t  Note that we are not interested in the actual codes but only in their lengths  they allow us to determine the complexity of a model A more complex and more interesting approach to encode a t succinct is to have several coding tables from which the transmitter chooses one for transmission Choosing the coding table is done via a decision tree that branches on the values of other attributes in the same transaction That is we have a decision tree used for encoding a t in which each leaf node is associated with a different coding table of a t  The leaf is selected by testing the values of other attribute s within the same transaction Example 1 Assume that we have three attributes a  b  and c and consider the trees given in Figure 1 In Figure 1\(a we have the simplest tree a simple coding table with no dependencies at all A more complex tree is given in Figure 1\(b where the transmitter chooses from two coding table for a based on the value of c  Similarly in Figure 1\(d we have

These universal codes provide a cost called the complexity of the model This cost can be calculated as follows let L be a leaf in the decision tree i.e coding table and M be the number of transactions for which L is used Then the complexity of this leaf denoted by c MDL  L   is c MDL  L   log M X k 0 022 M k 023 022 k M 023 k 022 M 000 k M 023 M 000 k  In general there is no known closed formula for the complexity of the model Hence estimates are usually employed 29  H o w e v e r  f o r o u r t r e e m o d e l s w e c a n a p p l y an existing linear-time algorithm that solves the complexi ty for multinomial models 21  W e s h o u l d a l s o p o i n t o u t t h a t the Re\002ned MDL is asymptotically equivalent to Bayes Information Criteria BIC if the number of transactions goes to in\002nity and the number of free parameters stays 002xed However for moderate numbers of transactions there may be signi\002cant differences 13  Now that the coding tables can be transmitted we need to know how to transmit the actual tree T  To encode the tree we simply transmit the nodes of the tree in a sequence We use one bit to indicate whether the node is a leaf or an intermediate node N 2 intr  T   For an intermediate node we additionally use log K bits where K is the number of attributes in D  to indicate the item that is used for the split The combined cost of a tree T  denoted by c  T   is c  T   X N 2 intr  T  000 1  log K 001  c D  T   X L 2 lvs  T  000 1  c MDL  L  001  that is the cost c  T  is the number of bits needed to transmit the tree and the attribute a t in each transaction of D  Example 5 Assume that we have a dataset with 100 transactions and 3 items Assume also that q D  a  0  q D  a  1  0  5  We know that the complexity of the leaves in this case is c MDL  L   3  25  The cost of the tree T 3 Figure 1\(c is c  T 3  1  log 3  1  3  25  50  000 0  3 log 0  3 000 0  7 log 0  7  1  3  25  50  000 0  1 log 0  1 000 0  9 log 0  9 69  8  Given a decision tree model T  f T 1      T K g we de\002ne the cost c  T   P i c  T i   The cost c  T  is the number of bits needed to transmit the trees one for each attribute and the complete dataset D  We should point out that for data with many items the term log K grows and hence the threshold increases for selecting an attribute into any decision tree This is an inter esting behavior as due to the 002nite number of transactions for datasets with many items there is an increased probability that two items will correlate even though they are independent according to the generative distribution 3.3 Greedy Algorithm Our goal is to 002nd the decision tree model with the lowest complexity cost However since many problems related to the decision trees are NP complete 26 w e w i l l r e s o r t t o a greedy heuristic to approximate the decision tree model T with the lowest c  T   It is based on the ID3 algorithm To fully introduce the algorithm we need some notation By T RIVIAL T REE  a t  we mean the simplest tree packing a t without any other attributes see Figure 1\(a Given a tree T  a leaf L 2 lvs  T   and an item c not occurring in the path from L to the root of T  we de\002ne S PLIT T REE  T L c  to be a new tree where L is replaced by a non-leaf node testing the value of c and having two leaves as the branches The algorithm G REEDY P ACK starts with a tree model consisting only of trivial trees The algorithm 002nds the tre e which saves the most bits by splitting To ensure that the decision tree model is valid G REEDY P ACK builds a dependency graph G describing the dependencies of the trees and makes sure that G is acyclic The algorithm terminates when no further split can be made that saves any bits Algorithm 1 G REEDY P ACK algorithm constructs a decision tree model T  f T 1      T K g from a binary data D  1 V  f v 1      v K g  E    2 G   V E   3 T i  T RIVIAL T REE  a i   for i  1      K  4 while there are changes do 5 for i  1      K do 6 O i  T i  7 for L 2 lvs  T i   j  1      K do 8 if E   v i  v j  is acyclic and a j  2 path  L  then 9 U  S PLIT T REE  T i  L a j   10 if c  U   c  O i  then 11 O i  U  s i  j  12 end if 13 end if 14 end for 15 end for 16 k  arg min i f c  O i  000 c  T i  g  17 if c  O k   c  T k  then 18 T k  O k  19 E  E   v k  v s k   20 end if 21 end while 22 return f T 1      T K g

4 Itemsets and Decision Trees So far we have discussed how to transmit binary data by using decision trees In this section we present how to selec t the itemsets representing the dependencies implied by the decision trees We will use this link in Section 5 A similar link between itemsets and decision trees is explored in 27 although our setup and goals are different Given a leaf L  the dependency of the item a t is captured in the coding table of L  Hence we are interested in 002nding itemsets that carry the same information That is itemsets from which we can compute the coding table To derive the codes for the leaf L it is suf\002cient to compute the probability q D  a t  1 j L   q D  a t  1  L  q D  L   1 Our goal is to express the probabilities on the right side of the equation using itemsets In order to do that let P be the path from L to its root Let pos  L  be the items along the path P which are tested positive Similarly let neg  L  be the attributes which are tested negative Using the inclusion-exclusion principle we see that q D  L   q D  pos  L   1  neg  L   0  X V 022 neg  L   000 1 j V j f r  pos  L   V   2 We compute q D  a t  1  L  in a similar fashion Let us de\002ne sets  L  for a given leaf L to be sets  L   f V  pos  L  j V 022 neg  L  g  f V  pos  L   f a t g j V 022 neg  L  g  Combining Eqs 1–2 we see that the collection sets  L  satis\002es our goal Proposition 6 The coding table associated with the leaf L can be computed from the frequencies of sets  L   Example 7 Let L 1  L 2  and L 3 be the leaves from left to right of T 4 in Figure 1\(d Then the corresponding families of itemsets are sets  L 1   f a ac g  sets  L 2   f b ab bc abc g  and sets  L 3   f  a b ab c ac bc abc g  We can easily see that the family sets  L  is essentially the smallest family of itemsets from which the coding table can be derived uniquely Proposition 8 Let G 6  sets  L  be a family of itemsets Then there are two data sets say D 1 and D 2  for which q D 1  a t  1 j L  6  q D 2  a t  1 j L  but f r  G  D 1   f r  G  D 2   Given a tree T we de\002ne sets  T  to be sets  T   S L 2 lvs  T  sets  L   We also de\002ne sets  T   S i sets  T i  where T  f T 1      T K g is a decision tree model 5 Choosing Good Itemsets The connection between itemsets and decision trees made in the previous section allows us to consider an orthogonal approach to identify good itemsets Informally our goal is to construct decision trees from a family of itemsets F  selecting the subset from F that provides the best compression of the data More formally our new approach is as follows given a downward closed family of itemsets F  we build a decision tree model T  f T 1      T K g providing a good compression of the data with sets  T  022 F  Before we can describe our main algorithm we need to introduce some further notation Firstly given two trees T p and T n not using attribute c  we de\002ne J OIN T REE  c T p  T n  to be the join tree with c as the root node T p as the positive branch of c  and T n as the negative branch of c  Secondly to de\002ne our search algorithm we need to 002nd the best tree bt  a t  S F   arg min T f c  T  j t  T   a t  src  T  022 S sets  T  022 F g  that is bt  a t  S F   returns the best tree for a t for which the related sets are in F and only splits on attributes in S  To compute the optimal tree bt  a t  S F   we use the exhaustive method presented originally in 27  g i v e n i n A l gorithm 2 The algorithm is straightforward it tests each valid item as the root and recurses itself on both branches Algorithm 2 G ENERATE algorithm for calculating bt  a t  S F   that is the best tree T for a t using only S as source and having sets  T  022 F  1 B  S   S F   2 C  T RIVIAL T REE  a t   3 for b 2 B do 4 G  f X 000 b j b 2 X 2 F g  5  D p  D n   S PLIT  D b   6 T p  G ENERATE  a t  G  S D p   7 T n  G ENERATE  a t  G  S D n   8 C  C  J OIN T REE  b T p  T n   9 end for 10 return arg min T f c  T  j T 2 Cg  We can now describe the actual algorithm for constructing decision tree models with a low cost Our method automatically discovers the order in which the attributes can be transmitted most succinct For this it needs to 002nd sets of attributes S i for each attribute a i such that these should be encoded before a i  The collection S  f S 1      S K g should de\002ne an acyclic graph and the actual trees are bt  a i  S i  F   We use c  S  as a shorthand for the total complexity P i c  bt  a i  S i  F  of the best model built from S

We construct the set S iteratively At the beginning of the algorithm we have S i   and we increase the sets S i one attribute at a time We allow ourselves to mark the attributes The idea is that once the attribute a i is marked then we are not allowed to augment S i any longer At the beginning none of the nodes are marked To describe a single step in the algorithm we consider a graph H   v 0      v K   where v 1      v K represent the attributes and v 0 is a special auxiliary node We start by adding edges  v i  v 0  having the weight c  bt  a i  S i  F   thus the cost of the best tree possible from F using only the attributes in S i  Then for each unmarked node v i we 002nd out what other extra attribute will help most to encode it succinct To do this we add the edge  v i  v j  for each v j with the weight c  bt  a i  S i  f a j g  F   Now let U be the minimum directed spanning tree of H having v 0 as the sink Consider an unmarked node v i such that  v i  v 0  2 E  U   That node is now the best choice to be 002xed as it helps to encode the data best We therefore mark attribute a i and add a i to each S j for each ancestor v j of v i in U  This process is repeated until all attributes are marked The details of t he algorithm are given in Algorithm 3 Algorithm 3 The algorithm S ET P ACK constructs a decision tree model T given a family of itemsets F such that sets  T  022 F  Returns a DAG a family S   S 1      S K  of sets of attributes The trees are T i  bt  a i  S i  F   1 S   S 1      S K             2 r   r 1      r K    false      false   3 V  f v 0      v K g  4 while there exists r i  false do 5 E    6 for i  1      K do 7 E  E   v i  v 0   8 w  v i  v 0   c  bt  a i  S i  F   9 if r i  false then 10 for j  1      K do 11 T  bt  a i  S i  f a j g  F   12 if c  T  024 w  v i  v 0  then 13 E  E   v i  v j   w  v i  v j   c  T   14 end if 15 end for 16 end if 17 end for 18 U  dmst  V E  f Directed Min Spanning Tree g 19 for  v i  v 0  2 E  U  and r i  false do 20 r i  true  21 for v j is a parent of v i in U do 22 S j  S j  a i  23 end for 24 end for 25 end while 26 return S  The marking of the attributes guarantees that there can be no cycles in S  In fact the marking order also tells us a valid order for transmitting the attributes Further as at least one attribute is marked at each step this guarantees that th e algorithm terminates in K steps Let S be the collection of sources The following proposition tells us that the augmentation performed by S ET P ACK does not compromise the optimality of collections next to S  Proposition 9 Assume the collection of sources S  f S 1      S K g  Let O  f O 1      O K g be the collection of sources such that S i 022 O i and j O i j 024 j S i j  1  Let S 0 be the collection that Algorithm 3 produces from S in a single step Then there is a collection S 003 such that S 0 i 022 S 003 i and that c  S 003  024 c  O   Proof Let G be the graph constructed by Algorithm 3 for the collection S  Construct the following graph W  For each O i such that O i  S i add the edge  v i  v 0   For each O i 6  S i add the edge  v i  v j   where f a j g  O i 000 S i  But W is a directed spanning tree of G  Let U be the directed minimum spanning tree returned by the algorithm Let S 003 i  S 0 i if  v i  v 0  2 E  U  and S 003 i  S 0 i  f a j g if  v i  v j  2 E  U   Note that S 003 de\002nes a valid model and because U is optimal we must have c  S 003  024 c  O   Corollary 10 Assume that F is a family of itemsets having 2 items at maximum The algorithm S ET P ACK returns the optimal tree model Let us consider the complexity of the algorithms The algorithm S ET P ACK runs in a polynomial time By using dynamic programming we can show that G ENERATE runs in O  j F j 2  time We also tested a faster variant of the algorithm in which the exhaustive search in G ENERATE is replaced by the greedy approach similar to the ID3 algorithm We call this variant S ET P ACK G REEDY  6 Related Work Finding interesting itemsets is a major research theme in data mining To this end many measures have been suggested over time A classic measure for ranking itemsets is frequency for which there exist ef\002cient search algorithms 2 15  O t h e r m e a s u r e s i n v o l v e c o m p a r i n g h o w much an itemset deviates from the independence assumption 1,3,4,11  I n y e t o t h e r a p p r o a c h e s m o r e 003 e x i b l e m o d els are used such as Bayes networks 17 18  M a x i m u m Entropy estimates 24 31  R e l a t e d a r e a l s o l o w e n t r o p y sets itemsets for which the entropy of the data is low 16  Many of these approaches suffer from the fact that they require a user-de\002ned threshold and further that at low thresholds extremely many itemsets are returned many of which convey the same information To address the latter

returns small subsets of itemsets th at together capture the distribution of the data well These code tables have been successfully applied in classi\002cation 22  m e a s u r i n g t h e d i s s i m

the items that are present in the dataset On the other hand we consider the 0 s and the 1 s in the data symmetrically and hence we are able to provide more detailed descriptions of the data including patterns betwee n the presence and absence of items More different from our methods are the lossy data description approaches These strive to describe just part of the data and as such may overlook important interactions Summarization 7 i s a c o m p r e s s i o n a p p r o a c h t h a t i d e n t i 002 e s a group of itemsets such that each transaction is summarized by one set with as little

consider larger pattern sets However it also requires the user to choose a quality measure to which the pattern set has to be optimized unlike our parameterfree and lossless method Alternatively we can view the approach in this paper as building a global model for data and then selecting the itemsets that describe the model This approach then allows us to use MDL as a model selection technique In a related work 32 t h e a u t h o r s b u i l d d e c o m p o s a b l e m o d e l s i n o r d e r to select a small family of itemsets that model the data well The decision trees returned by our methods and particularly the DAG that they form have a passing resemblance to Bayes networks 9  H o w e v e r  a s b o t h t h e m o d e l c o n struction and complexity weighing differ strongly so do th e outcomes To be more precise in our case the distributions p  x par  x  are modeled and weighted via decision trees whereas in the Bayes network setup any distribution is weighted equally Furthermore we use the correspondence between the itemsets and the decision trees to output local patterns as opposed to Bayes networks which are traditionally used as global models 7 Experiments This section contains the results of the empirical evaluation of our methods using toy and real datasets 7.1 Datasets For the experimental validation of the two packing strategies we use a group of datasets with strongly differing stati stics From the LUCS/KDD repository 8 w e t o o k a n u m b e r of often used databases to allow for comparison to other methods To test our methods on real data we used the Mammals presence database and the Helsinki CS-courses dataset The latter contains the enrollment records of students taking courses at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Helsinki The mammals dataset consists of the absence/presence of European mammals 25 in geographical areas of 50x50 kilometers 1 The details of these datasets are provided in Table 1 Table 1

arti\002cial datasets of 2000 transactions and 10 items For both databases the data is generated per transaction and the presence of the 002rst item is based on a fair coin toss For the 002rst database the other items are similarly generated However for the second database the presence of an item is 90 dependent on the previous item As such both datasets have item densities of about 50 If we apply G REEDY P ACK  our greedy decision tree building method to these datasets we see that it is unable to compress the independent database at all Opposing the dependently generated dataset can be compressed into only 1 The full version of the dataset is available for research pur poses upon request http://www.european-mammals.org
