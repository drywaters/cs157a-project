Significant Cancer Risk Factor Extraction: An Asso ciation Rule Discovery Approach  Jesmin Nahar and Kevin S Tickle School of Computing Science, Faculty of Business an d Informatics Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD-470 2, Australia E-mail: {j.nahar,k.tickle@cqu.edu.au    Abstract  Cancer is the top most death threat for human life all over the world Current research in the cancer area is still struggling to provide better support to a cancer patient. In this research our aim is to identify the significant risk factors for  particular types of cancer. First, we constructed a risk factor data set through an extensive literature review of bladder breast cervical lung prostate and skin cancer We further employed three association rule mining algorithms Apriori Predictive apriori and Tertius algorithm in order to discover most significant risk factors for particular types of cancer. Discovery risk factor has been identified to shows highest confidence values We concluded that apriori indicates to be the best association rule-mining algorithm for significant risk factor discovery   1.  Introduction  Cancer is the one of the most common cause of death all over the world Furthermore in Australia United States and the United Kingdom breast cancer is the second leading cause of death [1   R e s e a r c h  s h o w s  t h a t  m o s t  o f  the cancers are not detected in the early stageresulting in high death rates. Medical practitioner  diagnostic systems mammography biopsies ultrasound etc can takes a long time to inform the patient about the cancer status thus early cancer prevention could save human life The aim of this research is to find out the different cancer risk factors using modern machine learning techniques. We consider bladder, breast cervical lung prostrate and skin cancer in this research Association Rule Mining ARM a particular method of machine learning technique could prove to have great potential within the medical domain identifying responsible factors for a specific disease The ARM technique has been considered as a tool for our research  The use of association rules on medical data records with heart perfusion measurements is explored for the first time in 2   D i s c o v e r i n g  association rules on segmented images is studied in [3   A n o t h e r  s t u d y  u s e  a s s o c i a t i o n  r u l e  m i n i n g  algorithm to study associations of different female hormones with the occurrence of breast cancer and also bench mark the performance of artificial neural networks ANN and data envelopment analysis \(DEA\ against the standard parametric Fisher\222s linear discriminant analysis FLDA technique 4   H o  e t  a l  p r e s e n t e d  a n  induction data mining approach in order to predict cervical cancer by using a combination of demographic, environmental and genetic factors They examined the risk factors for cervical cancer using a combination of logistic regression and a decision tree algorithm and reported the relationship among demographic environmental and genetic factors for cervical cancer using induction technique. In addition, to the induction technique, they compared logistic regression and the decision tree algorithm and present the practical use of rule induction for the management of cervical cancer 5   T h e i r  emphasis was on a specific cancer with several limitations to their research One being the limited access to data relying on one single source subjecting themselves to bias in an otherwise potentially data rich subject group its Sufficient validation for the generalization of their findings to other geographic areas or groups was not performed. The other limitation was the lack of input variables for patient characteristics  such as exercise behaviour, nutrition, stress, and depression Further study limitations also included a low sensitivity for the logistic regression and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection CHAID algorithm An association rule mining algorithm was applied to 


extract associations between the selected socioeconomic variables and the colorectal, lung breast, and prostate cancers mortality from 1988 to 1992 cancer mortality rates in United States 6   G e o g r a p h i c  i n f o r m a t i o n  s y s t e m  t e c h n o l o g y  is used for data integration which is defined at different spatial resolutions, and to visualize and  analyze the results from the association rule mining process This study provided the emphasis on mortality rates We failed to find a single study which was able to demonstrate on the significant risk factor for a specific cancer We therefore decided to contribute towards cancer risk factor issue through this research  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ris k factor extraction research using association rule mining algorithms Our paper is organized as follows section two will explain the problem description. Data collection evidence is described in section three The association rule mining algorithm is summarized in section four In section five, we publish our experimental finding concluding in section six  2.0 Problem Descriptions  We initially we considered bladder breast cervical, lung, prostrate and skin cancer oriented risk factors This section will summarize each problem definition and its significance  2.1 Bladder Cancer Bladder cancer is a cancer where abnormal cells multiply without control in the bladder In most of the cases bladder cancer begins in cells lining of the bladder and is called urothelial cell or transitional cell carcinoma \(UCC or TCC\. If the bladder cancer that is only in the lining is called  superficial bladder cancer  and if the cancer spreads into the muscle wall of the bladder, it is called invasive bladder cancer  7   T h e  American Cancer Society estimates that in the United States there will be about 68,810 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in 2008 \(about 51,230 men and 17,580 women\. The chance of a man developing this at any time during his life is about 1 in 27 and for a woman, 1 in 85. In 2008 there will also be about 14,100 deaths from bladder cancer in the United States \(about 9,950 men and 4,150 women\ [8   T h e  c a n c e r  a f f e c t e d  bladder is presented in Figure 1   Figure 1 Affected cancer bladder shows by circle Source http://www.ecureme.com/emyhealth/data/Bladde r_Cancer.asp  2.2 Breast cancer Breast cancer is the combination of more than 100 different diseases Breast cancer develops while some of the cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. Cancerous growth begins to appear anywhere inside the breast Most breast cancers starts in the lining of the ducts though a small number can start in the milk sacs. In time if  not treated properly, cancer cells from the breast can spread to other parts of the body [8   O n e  i n  eight Australian women will develop breast cancer before the age of 85 In Australia about 12,000 women and 84 men were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 In 2005 breast cancer caused 502,000 deaths worldwide \(7% of cancer deaths almost 1 of all deaths It is predicted that by 2011, the number of new diagnoses will increase to about 14,800 women and 122 men 7   T h e  c a n c e r  a f f e c t e d  b r e a s t  i s  p r e s e n t e d  i n  Figure 2   Figure  2.

The lungs are made up with three right lobes and two left lobes As soon as we breathe air goes through the nose , down the windpipe \(trachea\, and into the lungs where it spreads through tubes called bronchi The majority of lung cancer begins in the cells that line these tubes [7   S t a t i s t i c s  s h o ws that for both men and women people die from lung cancer more often than any other type of cancer In 2004 lung cancer accounted for more deaths than breast cancer prostate cancer and colon cancer combined In that year 108,355 men and 87,897 women were diagnosed with lung cancer and 9,575 men and 68,431 women died from lung cancer During 2008 there will be about 215,020 new cases of lung cancer 114,690 among men and 100,330 among women 8   T h e  c a n c e r  a f f e c t e d  l u n g  i s  s h o w n  in Figure 4  Figure 4  Lung cancer Source http://search.live.com/images   2.5 Prostate cancer  The cancer which originates in the  prostate with an uncontrolled \(malignant\ growth of cells in the prostate gland which is located at the base of the urinary bladder and is responsible for helping control urination as well as forming part of the semen. It is a common malignancy in men older than 50 years of old and it may cause no symptoms in the early stage. Prostate cancer may remain in the prostate gland or may spread to nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body. It is a second leading cause of death of males in the U.S.A. In Australia one in nine males affects for prostate cancer at the age of 75 years and one on five by the age 85 years The death rate of prostate cancer is lower which is one in 84 men under the age of 75 years and one in 22 by the age of 85 years 10   T h e  p r o s t a t e  c a n c e r  i s  shown in Figure 5

Each year the annual rates of all forms of skin cancer are increasing representing a growing public concern. Research estimated that nearly half of all Americans who live to age 65 will develop skin cancer at least once www.cpaaindia.org  The affected skin cancer is shown in Figure 6     Figure  6.

Due to lake of space the sources of data are not available here. All the data are available upon request  4.0 Association Rule Mining In this section we introduce the standard definition of association learning  11,12   A n  association rule is a simple rule, such as  Smoking 307  family_history_positve 001  lung_cancer  Where 221Smoking 307  family_history_positve\222 is called the body rule and lung_cancer the head of the rule. It associates the rule body with its head   In context of medical data our example expresses the fact that people who are smoking and past family history have lung cancer are likely to have risk of lung cancer This association rule makes no assertion about people who are not getting skin or breast cancer  Let D be a database consisting of one table over n attributes {a 1 a 2 205 ,a n and the table contain k  instances. In the following an attribute-value-pair  will be called an item An item set is a set of distinct attribute-value-pairs For instance smoking family_history_positve lung_cancer and so on  Let d be a database record and it satisfies an item set X  315 a 1 a 2 205 ,a n if X  315  d An association rule is an implication X  256  Y  where X  Y  315 a 1  a 2 205 ,a n  Y  271  f and X 307 Y f   The support   s   and confidence   c  are two measures of rule interestingness that reflect usefulness and certainty of a rule respectively The association rules that satisfy user specified minimum support threshold  minSup  and minimum confidence threshold  minCon  are called strong association rules. The formulations of support and confidence measure are as follows  Support X  256  Y  P X 307 Y Confidence X  256  Y  P Y|X  P\(X  X P  307 Y   where P  is used for probability measure in support and conditional probability in confidence A probabilistic interpretation of support and confidence is discussed in 13   Another rule measure metric called lift defined as   Lift X  256  Y   P\(X\P\(Y  P\(X  307 Y   Lift quantifies the relationship between X and Y  Basically a lift value greater than 1 provides strong evidence that X  and Y  depend on each other. A lift value below 1 state X depends on the absence of Y or vice versa 


 The task for association rule mining can be divided into two folds  267  Find all combinations of the risk factors for a specific cancer whose supports are greater than a user-specified minimum support \(threshold  267  Use the risk factors from frequent risk factors to generate the desired rules Generally the confidence of each rule is computed and if it is above the confidence threshold the retrieve the rule in the system  Among the long list of association learning algorithms Apriori 11   P r e d i c t i v e  A p r i o r i   1 4    Tertius 15  a r e  m o s t  p o p u l a r  a l g o r i t h m s  i n  t h e  machine learning community The Apriori algorithm is a state of the art algorithm most of the association rule algorithms are somewhat variations of this algorithm [11    5.0 Experimental Results  We considered three association rule mining algorithms Apriori Predictive Apriori and Tertius for our experiment We found among these three algorithms Apriori to be the number one choice to extract useful rules for our cancer data set The reputed rules were selected based on confidence and lift measure. All the reported rules obtained confidence 1. However, in the lift measure all types of cancer discussed in this paper show a stable performance except prostate cancer as shown in Figure 7. The breast data-set shows the highest lift values while on the other hand skin cancer showed the worst lift values                                                                                                                               0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 TOP10 TOP20 TOP30 TOP40 TOP50 No of Top Rules Lift    Bladder   Breast   Cervical      Lung        Prostate   Skin    Figure 7 Lift performances measures with Apriori association rule mining algorithm for six types of cancer problems  Moreover we verified Apriori performance with leverage measures as shown in Figure 8. Similar to lift measures we found all other types of cancers suggested similar steady performance except prostate cancer The most reliable performance was shown with the skin type cancer data-set while breast cancer data demonstrated the worst performance in the leverage measure                                                                                                                              0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 TOP10 TOP20 TOP30 TOP40 TOP50 No of Top Rules Leverage    Bladder   Breast   Cervical      Lung        Prostate   Skin    Figure 8 Leverage performances measures with Apriori association rule mining algorithm for six types of cancer problems   Finally we compared the apriori performance with conviction measures as shown in Figure 9 We found similar steady performances for all the cancer data set except prostate cancer showing the highest performance.

 7. Conclusions  In this paper we have proposed an intelligent and efficient technique to reassess the distances between dynamic XML documents when one or all of the initially clustered documents have changed. After the changes, the initial clustering solution might become obsolete - the distances between clustered XML documents might have changed more or less depending on the degree of modifications \(insert update, delete\hich have been applied. Re-running full pair-wise comparisons on the entire set of modified documents is not a viable option, because of the large number of redundant operations involved Our proposed technique allows the user to reassess the pair-wise XML document distances, not by fully comparing each new pair of versions in the clustering solution, but by determining the effect of the temporal changes on the previously known distances between them. This approach is both time and I/O effective, as the number of operations involved in distance reassessing is greatly reduced  References  1  Beringer, J. and H\374llermeier, E., Online clustering of parallel data streams Data and Knowledge Engineering 58\(2\,  2006, 180-204 2  Catania, B. and Maddalena A., A Clustering Approach for XML Linked Documents, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22202\, IEEE 2002 3  Chen, M.S., Han, J. and Yu, P., Data Mining: An Overview from Database Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol. 8, 1996, 866-883 4  Cormen, T., Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R Introduction to algorithms, MIT Press, 1990 5  Costa, G., Manco, G., Ortale, R. and Tagarelli, A., A tree-based Approach to Clustering XML documents by Structure, PAKDD 2004, LNAI 3202, 137-148 Springer 2004 6  Dalamagas, T., Cheng, T., Winkel, K.J. and Sellis, T 2004, Clustering XML documents by Structure SETN 2004, LNAI 3025, 112-121, Springer 2004 7  Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Wimmer,M. and Xu, X., Incremental Clustering for Mining in a Data Warehousing Environment, Proc.of the 24 th VLDB Conference, New York, USA, 1998 8  Garofalakis, M., Rastogi, R., Seshadri, S.

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions This work was supported by NSERC
