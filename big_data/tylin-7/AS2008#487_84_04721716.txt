Xi'an Jiao Tong University Xi'an 710049 Email wenzhizhu@mail.xjtu.edu.cn Abstract Optimization of automatic control is very important in ball mill pulverizing system and a novel association rule decision algorithm based on ant colony optimization algorithm ACO is proposed for improving the control performance The proposed algorithm based on ACO formulates the association rule decision problem as an optimization problem In the algorithm a new pheromone matrix is de\002ned on the construction of the problem and an effective heuristic values assignment approach which is used with the knowledge of controlled plant is proposed The 002tness function is established on the system control quality such as the overshoot the settling time and the steady state error We performed the experiments on a mined association rules base of ball mill pulverizing system Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can 002nd the best association rule to optimize the system control performance I I NTRODUCTION Optimization of automatic control is an important issue in Ball Mill Pulverizing System Operating optimization is to 002nd the best working condition in current running state It means determining the best set values of the controlled variables Generally set values of the controlled variables are given by the manufacturers or determined by the 002eld testing However the best set values which make industrial process running more steadily and ef\002ciently will shift with the running environment changes Therefore tracing the best set values of industrial process becomes a research focus Researchers have proposed many methods in this 002eld Genetic algorithm is an effective method and it may be easily falling to over convergence or low convergence Neural netw ork does not depend on mathematical model and the standard data for training are not easily to get Fuzzy optimization algorithm can decide the optimization searching step by the 002eld data but the membership functions and the fuzzy rules require expert knowledge Data mining is a new technology to mine information and knowledge from the 002eld data W e can mine the association rules from the 002eld database of the controlled plant in form of if    then     The antecedent represents controlled variables values as the consequent represents the system status First we query the existing AR base to con\002rm current system status Then we anti-query the AR base with the consequent part to select the best rule to set values of the controlled variables for good control performance In the anti-querying process more than one association rule would be found Therefore the decision of an appropriate association rule for good control performance in the following is referred to as AR decision problem Some researches 6 ha v e proposed different schemes for learning the relations of fuzzy inputs and fuzzy outputs and they are limited to selecting a small number of signi\002cant fuzzy if-then rules to construct a compact fuzzy classi\002cation system with high classi\002cation power using optimization models The AR decision problem can be regarded as a combinational problem which is a bit different and can not be easily solved Ant colony optimization ACO is a new paradigm of bio-inspired algorithms that has shown very good behavior when solving hard combinatorial optimization and many studies on this topic are still being pursued 8 We propose a novel association rule decision algorithm based on ant colony optimization for ball mill pulverizing system The AR decision problem is 002rstly formulated as an optimization problem and the ACO is applied to the optimization problem In the algorithm the new pheromone matrix de\002nition and the heuristic values assignment are proposed for the AR decision problem The 002tness function is established on the control quality of ball mill pulverizing system such as the overshoot the settling time and the steady state error The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 summarizes some important background information The proposed decision algorithm is introduced in Section 3 Section 4 presents the simulation results Finally section 5 conclusions the paper II B ACKGROUND I NFORMATION The schematic representation of a ball mill pulverizing system is shown in Figure 1 The ball mill is fed with raw coal At the same time the hot air and recycle air are blown into the ball mill to dry and deliver the coal powder After pulverizing the coal powder is transferred into the coarse classi\002er and 002ne classi\002er The unquali\002ed powder is fed back into the ball mill for further pulverizing while the accepted powder is stored in the pulverized coal bunker Output capability which includes pulverizing capability drying capability and air draft capability mainly represents the ef\002ciency of ball mill pulverizing system Drying capability and air draft capability can be represented by measuring the outlet temperature and the inlet negative pressure respectively

Fig 1 Ball mill pulverizing system Although pulverizing capability can not be measured directly it is related to ball mill load The ball mill load is the ratio between the volume of coal powder in the mill and the interstitial volume of the static ball charge To control the ball mill pulverizing system to work at the optimal state means setting the three controlled variables values to get a high output capability Association rules which represent the relationships between the three controlled variables and system output capability can be mined from the 002eld database to build the AR base Fuzzy sets can represent the association rules in a natural and humanunderstandable way when quantitative attributes are involved  Then the fuzzy AR base is b uilt a part of fuzzy AR are shown in Table 1 In the table X 1  X 2  X 3 and Y present the linguistic variables of ball mill load outlet temperature inlet negative pressure and pulverizing system output capability respectively The set of fuzzy linguistic variables are adopted as f NB NM NS ZO PS PM PB g  NB NM NS ZO PS PM and PB represent negative big negative middle negative small zero positive small positive middle and positive big respectively TABLE I E XAMPLE OF FUZZY AR BASE IF THEN N O X 1 X 2 X 3 Y 1 P M P M N S P M 2 P S P S P B P M 3 N B N B N B N B      Let A 1 i  A 2 i  A 3 i and B i be linguistic terms the fuzzy AR structure can be written as AR i  IF X 1 is A 1 i and X 2 is A 2 i and X 3 is A 3 i  THEN Y is B i For example it is assumed that the current measured values of ball mill load outlet temperature and inlet negative pressure are transformed to fuzzy sets as NB NB NB respectively Then we query the fuzzy AR base as Table 1 shows with the antecedent set f NB NB NB g  and 002nd AR 3 as the matching AR The corresponding consequent set NB represents the current pulverizing system output capability Since the system control objective is to get high output capability namely Y should be PB we anti-query the fuzzy AR base and 002nd AR 1 and AR 2  We have two groups of set values of ball mill load outlet temperature and inlet negative pressure as f PM PM NS g or f PS PS PB g  The controller can control the controlled variables be the set values After the system is steady the ball mill pulverizing system will get a high output capability value PB with either of the two ARs Because the set values of three controlled variables in AR 1 and AR 2 are different the selection of the two ARs will lead to different system control performance III AR DECISION ALGORITHM BY ACO In the paper an AR decision Algorithm based on ACO for the ball mill pulverizing system is proposed The block diagram of the Algorithm is shown in Figure 2 bml  ot and inp are the measure values of the ball mill load the outlet temperature and the inlet negative pressure respectively bml sv  ot sv and inp sv are the set values of bml  ot and inp  Fig 2 AR decision algorithm based on ACO In the AR decision problem more than one association rule will be found Let R i  i 1     r  be a found AR and r is the number of found association rules The combination of the three variables in R i is AR antecedent combination Ac i  Moreover we de\002ne the candidate AR antecedent combination is from the set Ac  f Ac 1    Ac r g  For each consequent value one of the r candidate AR antecedent combinations is chosen If c is the number of consequent values in the AR decision problem then we have to decide the best one from a total of r c AR decision combinations This leads to a combinational optimization problem One selected controlled variables antecedent combination of all association rules corresponds to one ant move For example in Figure 3 there are four consequent values denoted by B 1 B 4  and four candidate AR antecedent combinations Ac 1 Ac 4 for each consequent value The ant moves through B 1  B 2  B 3  and stops at B 4 from the initial state A bold line marks the tour of this ant The node visited by ant is selected as the antecedent of the association rule For the whole AR decision constructed by the ant in Figure 3 the selected antecedent parts in B 1  B 2  B 3 and B 4 are Ac 1  Ac 3  Ac 2  Ac 4  respectively In the initial of the algorithm a colony of ants is generated and placed in the nest and a terminal condition is de\002ned as the total number of searching iterations Searching for the best one among all AR decisions is based on the pheromone level which is stored in a pheromone matrix shown in Figure 3 the size of the pheromone matrix is c  r and each entry in the matrix is denoted by  ij  where i 1     c and j 1     r  When

to their semantic relevance. In fact, the purpose of the first phrase ranking is to find semantically equivalent web service candidates. Based on the ranking obtained in the first phrase, the second phrase that mainly considers context equivalence is implemented. In this phrase, service context is referenced and then realize the relevance reranking Let S = {S 1 S 2 S n be a web service collection and Q = {T 1 T 2 T m consisting of several keywords be the submitted query. By implementing OWL-S based approach, web services in S can be semantically ranked and the ranking result is formed as Ranking Semantic S i  S j S k  To further evaluate web service relevance, context equivalence of the top m web services in the ranking list achieved above is further evaluated. Assuming QC QC 1 QC 2 QC s contains the related web services with which the required web service join together, SC i  SC i 1 SC i t includes the web services heavily dependent with web service candidate S i in Ranking Semantic where each SC i j SC i j,1  SC i j,v  satisfies confidence\(S i  SC i j   the context equivalence of S i is then evaluated as     SC              SC         SC    Ranking t i  2 i  1 i  Context 2 1 QC QC CF QC QC CF QC QC CF S t i i i i i i SC S SC S SC S i         3 Synthetically considering the semantic equivalence and context equivalence of web service S i the relevance of S i to query Q is finally defined as   Ranking  1       Ranking    S  Q Relevance Context Semantic i i i S S        4 where represents the weights of the relevance factors namely semantic equivalence and context equivalence can be valued by empirical approach  7. Conclusions  Web service discovery is one of the fundamental problems in web service based applications. A lot of efforts have been attained in this problem among them semantic based web service discovery methods has shown encouraging performance. However, after retrieving a set of semantically equivalent web service candidates, which one is the best suitable with respect to user’s requirements is a potential challenge. In this paper, we studied the possibility of employing context awareness into web service discovery process and proposed a framework to build context for users and providers to capture user’s real need and capture the provider’s real intention to some extent. The context in this paper is built by using association rule to mining the frequent pattern from web service composition history. After that, a re-ranking mechanism is proposed for ranking the semantically equivalent web service candidates. It is anticipated that the proposed framework will help to alleviate the confusion for users in selecting the right web service during the web service discovery  8.

 7. Conclusions  In this paper we have proposed an intelligent and efficient technique to reassess the distances between dynamic XML documents when one or all of the initially clustered documents have changed. After the changes, the initial clustering solution might become obsolete - the distances between clustered XML documents might have changed more or less depending on the degree of modifications \(insert update, delete\hich have been applied. Re-running full pair-wise comparisons on the entire set of modified documents is not a viable option, because of the large number of redundant operations involved Our proposed technique allows the user to reassess the pair-wise XML document distances, not by fully comparing each new pair of versions in the clustering solution, but by determining the effect of the temporal changes on the previously known distances between them. This approach is both time and I/O effective, as the number of operations involved in distance reassessing is greatly reduced  References  1  Beringer, J. and H\374llermeier, E., Online clustering of parallel data streams Data and Knowledge Engineering 58\(2\,  2006, 180-204 2  Catania, B. and Maddalena A., A Clustering Approach for XML Linked Documents, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22202\, IEEE 2002 3  Chen, M.S., Han, J. and Yu, P., Data Mining: An Overview from Database Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol. 8, 1996, 866-883 4  Cormen, T., Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R Introduction to algorithms, MIT Press, 1990 5  Costa, G., Manco, G., Ortale, R. and Tagarelli, A., A tree-based Approach to Clustering XML documents by Structure, PAKDD 2004, LNAI 3202, 137-148 Springer 2004 6  Dalamagas, T., Cheng, T., Winkel, K.J. and Sellis, T 2004, Clustering XML documents by Structure SETN 2004, LNAI 3025, 112-121, Springer 2004 7  Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Wimmer,M. and Xu, X., Incremental Clustering for Mining in a Data Warehousing Environment, Proc.of the 24 th VLDB Conference, New York, USA, 1998 8  Garofalakis, M., Rastogi, R., Seshadri, S.

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the
