Association rules mining is an important research area in data mining, which indicates relations among itemsets in database.With the accumulation of the data association rule mining in large data set attracts more and more attention Algorithm AP  is one of t h e ol dest and m o st versatile algorithms of Frequent Pattern Mining\(FPM Although it was beaten most of the time by sophisticated DFS algorithms,such as lcm  n d clat [4],its m e rits are undisputable.Its advantages and its moderate traverse of the search space pay off when mining very large databases.Since then,many improved algorithms had been proposed.For example,the algorithms of AprioriTID and Apriori Hybird are described in t s va riants to find frequent sequences of ite ms pisodes 7],Boolean Formulas and labele d gr aphs 9 10 ha ve pr ove n t o  be efficient algorithms as well Recently,many researches have tried to find efficient methods and technologies to improve Apriori:hash optim r ansact ion and itemsets com p ression optimization  the di vision optimization  sam pling optimization, dynamic itemsets count optimization[13],and so on.Reference scanning the database only once.Refer to s t ore operation of the database with a cross chain to reduce the number of connections.Reference[1  h e data base  directly into main memory, carrying out association rules mining on the serv er-side.A excellent premises of absolutely join is presented,the candidate 4k-itemsets are built directly with absolutely join wh ile creating the candidate\(2k+1 itemsets from L 2k and only used the absolutely join for L 2k+1 to create the candidate \(4k+2\em Based on the achievement of forefather,this paper proposed a novel algorithm Red uced Apriori Algorithm with Tag\(RAAT\o improve Apriori al gorithm by the way of a decrease of pruning operations which generates the candidate 2-itemsets by the new apriori-gen operation. Besides,it adopts the tag-counting method to cal culate support quickly.So the bottleneck is overcame II BASIC CONCEPTION A Association Rules The concept of the association ru les was first proposed by R.Agrawal.It is used to describe the patterns of customers purchase in the supermarket.The association rules can be formally defined as Definition 1: Let I  i  i  i  i  123 n be finite itemsets D is a transactional database. Where i k k 1,2,É...m}\tem and Tid is the exclusive identifier of transaction T in transactional database Definition 2: Let X I,Y I  and X Y  The implication of the form X  Y is called an association rules. Where X I  Y I are purchases patterns of customer Definition 3:Let D is a transactional database.If the percentage of transactions in D that contain X U Y is s the rule X  Y holds in D with Support s If the percentage of transactions in D containing X that also contain Y is c the rule X  Y has Confidence c The definitions of probability are National Natural Science Foudition of ChinaNo.60173066  978-1-4244-2251-7/08/$25.00 ©2008 I E E E

The reason generating these redundant candidate itemsets is that the support of some \(k+1\temsets, which is supersets of the frequent itemsets in L k is smaller than the minsup. In order to make the ca rdinal number of candidate itemsets C k+1 be near to the cardinal number of frequent itemsets L k+1 the concept of the ge neration is introduced on the basis of Apriori,which gen erates the candidate 2-itemsets by the improvement of apriori-gen operation and the improvement subset operation In this way, we can reduce the cardinal number of the candidate itemsets in each loop and improve the efficiency of mining algorithm A  Reduced  Apriori-gen A Procedure apriori-gen L k-1  min_support  B for each itemset l 1 L k-1 C for each itemsets l 2 L k-1 D if l 1   l 2   l 1   l 2     l 1 k-2 l 2 k   l 1 k  l 2 k  E then F c  l 1 l 2 G for each k-1 ubsets s of c H if s l k-1  I delete c  J else add c to C k  K return C k L  M  N  As C 2 is connected by L 1 and pruning two-generated, of which pruning operations to test whether a subset of C 2 is frequent itemsets.Because C 2  L 1 L 1 the subset of the set must be frequent. Therefore, the new algorithm RAAT generate C 2 by the direct connection of L 1 rather than a pruningoperation B   Enhancement of Subset Procedure subset C k t  A For all candidates s C k B if t contains s C subset=subset s  D  Its running time is O \(| D K his is a very large number For example K 3, the transaction t \(x2, x6, x7, x9\the itemsets s x4, x6, x10\ Refinement of this sentence: if t contain s during a judge are the fo llowing conditions: if \(t contains x4 t contains x6 t contains x10\hen Obviously t does not contain s but still have to compare one by one The new algorithm improved th e subset opration through adding a Tag column on the transaction database,of which values are the first and the last numbers of itemses. If \(first item of x min last item of x max\n t contains s Otherwise t does not contain s  C    Design the New Algorithm of Mining Association Rules The new algorithm,using the concepts of the support and the generation to improve the efficiency of mining frequent itemsets, is also similar to Apri ori.It can be divided into two steps.First,the algorithm finds ou t all frequent itemsets.Then it generates all association rules from frequent itemsets Obviously, the second step is easy than first step,so we only describe the algorithm of the first step.We call this algorithm Reduced Apriori Algorithm with Tag\(RAAT\It can be described briefly as follows

system.The experiment data hase sources are T40.110 D100K,provided by the QUEST generator of data generated from IBM's Almaden lab.The testing results of experiments are showed in Fig.1 In the Fig.1, the hori zontal axis represents the number of support in database and the ver tical axis represents mining time \(second\of the same database with the algorithm Apriori and RAAT.The two curves denote different time cost of the algorithm Apriori and RAAT with different minsup VI C ONCLUTION From the above test results we can easily come to the conclusion that As for relatively small suppo rt, the new algorithm TAAT improves the rate of the efficiency much remarkably than Apriori algo rithm.This lies in that the smaller the minimum support threshold is,the larger the corresponding candidate itemsets are. Moreover the frequent itemsets are from the candidate itemsets and there is more of the workload to scan the database and computing support.The new algorithm reduced the operation of scaning the database and improve the efficiency of computi ng support pominently With the same support,the RAAT algorithm runs faster than the traditional on e.Thus, to reduce the C 2 pruning operations can be a very good method of cutting running time With the support increased, although the operating efficiencies of two algorithms have been enhanced due to the nature of apriori algorithm and removing nonfrequent itemsets timely,however,thesuperiority of RAAT is still evident R EFERANCE  d R.Sr ikant.Fast algorithms for mining association rules.The International Conference on Very Large Database , pages 487 499, 1994  m i and H.Ari m ura.

 7. Conclusions  In this paper we have proposed an intelligent and efficient technique to reassess the distances between dynamic XML documents when one or all of the initially clustered documents have changed. After the changes, the initial clustering solution might become obsolete - the distances between clustered XML documents might have changed more or less depending on the degree of modifications \(insert update, delete\hich have been applied. Re-running full pair-wise comparisons on the entire set of modified documents is not a viable option, because of the large number of redundant operations involved Our proposed technique allows the user to reassess the pair-wise XML document distances, not by fully comparing each new pair of versions in the clustering solution, but by determining the effect of the temporal changes on the previously known distances between them. This approach is both time and I/O effective, as the number of operations involved in distance reassessing is greatly reduced  References  1  Beringer, J. and H\374llermeier, E., Online clustering of parallel data streams Data and Knowledge Engineering 58\(2\,  2006, 180-204 2  Catania, B. and Maddalena A., A Clustering Approach for XML Linked Documents, Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22202\, IEEE 2002 3  Chen, M.S., Han, J. and Yu, P., Data Mining: An Overview from Database Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering vol. 8, 1996, 866-883 4  Cormen, T., Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R Introduction to algorithms, MIT Press, 1990 5  Costa, G., Manco, G., Ortale, R. and Tagarelli, A., A tree-based Approach to Clustering XML documents by Structure, PAKDD 2004, LNAI 3202, 137-148 Springer 2004 6  Dalamagas, T., Cheng, T., Winkel, K.J. and Sellis, T 2004, Clustering XML documents by Structure SETN 2004, LNAI 3025, 112-121, Springer 2004 7  Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Wimmer,M. and Xu, X., Incremental Clustering for Mining in a Data Warehousing Environment, Proc.of the 24 th VLDB Conference, New York, USA, 1998 8  Garofalakis, M., Rastogi, R., Seshadri, S.

5 Related Work There exists extensive previous work on both the mining of software repositories and on the use of clustering algorithms in software engineering This discussion focuses on the most similar and recent work in the area of software evolution Mining Software Repositories Our technique was partially inspired by the work of Zimmermann et al and Y ing et al 17 on the mining of association rules in change history As described in Section 1 we sought to expand the technique to be able to recommend larger but less precise clusters of elements to guide program navigation Bouktif et al also investigated how to recommend cochanges in software development As opposed to the work cited above Bouktif et al used change patterns instead of association rules Also their approach does not attempt to reconstruct transactions and can consider associated 002les that were changed in different transactions ChangeDistiller is a tool to classify changes in a transaction into 002ne-grained operations e.g addition of a method declaration and determines how strongly the change impacts other source code entities Our approach uses similar repository analysis techniques but is focused on providing task-related information as opposed to an overall assessment of a system's evolution Finally repository mining can also be used to detect aspects in the code In this conte xt aspects are recurring sets of changed elements that exhibit a regular structure Aspects differ from the clusters we detect in the regular structure they exhibit which may not necessarily align with the code that is investigated as part of change tasks Clustering Analysis The classical application of clustering for reverse engineering involves grouping software entities based on an analysis of various relations between pairs of entities of a given version of the system Despite its long and rich history  e xperimentation with this approach continues to this day For example Andreopoulos et al combined static and dynamic information K uhn et al used a te xtual similarity measure as the clustering relation and Christl et al used clustering to assist iterative semi-automated reverse engineering The main dif ferences b e tween most clusteringbased reverse engineering techniques and the subject of our investigation is that the entities we cluster are transactions rather than software entities in a single version of a system For this reason our analysis is based strictly on the evolving parts of the system Both Kothari et al and V an ya et al 15 recently reported on their use of clustering to study the evolution of software systems The idea of using change clusters is the same in both works and ours but the purpose of the work is different Kothari et al use change clusters to uncover the types of changes that happened e.g feature addition maintenance etc during the history of a software system Vanya et al use change clusters which they call evolutionary clusters to guide the partitioning of a system that would increase the likelihood that the parts of the system would evolve independently In contrast we cluster transactions based on overlapping elements not 002les to recommend clusters to support program navigation as opposed to architectural-level assessment of the system Finally Hassan and Holt evaluated on 002ve open source systems the performance of several methods to indicate elements that should be modi\002ed together This study found that using historical co-change information as opposed to using simple static analysis or code layout offered the best results in terms of recall and precision The authors then tried to improve the results using 002ltering heuristics and found that keeping only the most frequently cochanged entities yielded the best results As opposed to our approach the evaluated 002ltering heuristics were only applied on entities recovered using association rules and not using clustering techniques The focus of their study was also more speci\002c as they recommend program elements that were strictly changed  as opposed to recommending elements that might be inspected by developers 6 Conclusion Developers often need to discover code that has been navigated in the past We investigated to what extent we can bene\002t from change clusters to guide program navigation We de\002ned change clusters as groups of elements that were part of transactions or change sets that had elements in common Our analysis of close to 12 years of software change data for a total of seven different open-source systems revealed that less than 12 of the changes we studied could have bene\002ted from change clusters We conclude that further efforts should thus focus on maximizing the quality of the match between the current task and past transactions rather than 002nding many potential matches Our study has already helped us in this goal by providing reliable evidence of the effectiveness of some 002ltering heuristics and useful insights for the development of additional heuristics Acknowledgments The authors thank Emily Hill and Jos  e Correa for their advice on the statistical tests and the
