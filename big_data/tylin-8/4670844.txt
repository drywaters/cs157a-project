Experiment with Abilene network data verify this method Keywords\227 network traffic analysis, principal components analysis, time frequency analysis, symbolic time series analysis multiple time series data mining  I   I NTRODUCTION  Network traffic anomalies has the feature of erupting suddenly without known signs, which can bring great damage to network or computers in network in a short time. Therefore one of the prepositions to ensure a safe network is to detect network traffic anomalies fast and accurately, determine the reasons that causes them and make reasonable response to them in time. To decrease abnormal network traffic and reduce or eradicate attack of denial of service, large-scale communication network routing and switching equipment must possess abilities of detecting and analyzing network traffic behavior The features of large-scale communication network traffic are high speed and immense data while anomalous traffic is small and scattered in multiple links, which is hard to be detected among normal traffic. Moreover, parameters for analysis are limited. All these make anomaly identification very difficult Large-scale communication network traffic anomaly detection is mainly on three levels: packet level, flow level and network-wide level. The advantage of packet level traffic analysis is to provide elaborate information about user performance on the finest level of granularity and basic information about application layer, which in favor of description of anomalous features and fault diagnosis. For example, Snort[2   a s i g n at u r eb a s e d  in tr u s i o n d e t ect io n  system, summarize packet content in which special attack will appear as one attack feature in artificial ways, and this special attack can be determined if a packet has the same feature when intrusion detection system matches packet content. Ke Wang and Salvatore J.Stolfo  a d opt t h e w a y of u s i n g s t a t i s t i c a l  distribution of bytes ASCII code of packet to distinguish the content difference between normal packet and abnormal packet, then the normal connects and abnormal events. Masaki Ishiguro d i s t i ngu i s h e s  n e t w o r k w o r m s a t t a c k o r po rt s c a n through observing packet frequency to specific IP address by Bayesian classification method. But, because of the features of wide distribution, high speed and massive data possessed by large-scale communication network, capturing packet is hard to be implemented on large-scale network. Flow level traffic analysis is based on flow classification, collecting statistical information of each flow and providing performance information of users on medium granularity, which makes characterizing, detecting, diagnosing and restoring network convenient. The idea of flow level traffic analysis is to separate events, group abnormal types, search distributive model of anomaly and analyze anomaly pattern. Since Netflow is a good compromise for traffic analysis based on SNMP and packet in its performance and accuracy, the mainstream method of flow level traffic analysis is to be based on Netflow.  Network-wide traffic analysis uses the global traffic information, including path traffic, link traffic information, etc. for example, [5 deploys method of multi-way subspace to identify links with traffic anomaly Early network traffic analysis mainly focused on the laws that single traffic feature \(such as value of traffic, counts of bytes\ changes. But single traffic feature time series can not characterize large-scale communication network traffic completely and accurately, so problems like high false positives and false negatives can not be avoided. Lakhina [5 adopted method of multi-way subspace to detect and identify links with traffic feature anomaly. However, this study only used clustering analysis to obtain types of anomaly and did not study correlations among multiple traffic features Our contributions lie in: \(1\ aiming at traffic features of large-scale communication network, make every traffic feature simple time series; then take multiple traffic feature as a whole to analyze and study through multiple time series data mining 2\ search motif correlation pattern among anomalous segments of multiple time series within the same time interval by Multiple Time Series Data Mining\(MTSDM for short in the following\, analyze correlation patterns of multiple traffic feature anomaly and describe network security situation of large-scale network accurately and qualitatively 


  The rest of the paper is organized as the following. In Section II, we illustrate the process of network traffic analysis and three-level network traffic analysis frame. In section III we illustrate data preprocessing. In section IV we introduce multiple time series data mining method. In section V, we provide experiment and in section a conclusion II  T HE P ROCESS OF L ARGE SCALE C OMMUNICATION N ETWORK T RAFFIC A NALYSIS  A  Overview The process of large-scale communication network traffic analysis is shown in Fig. 1 Basically, in this paper, the process of large-scale communication network traffic analysis consists of the following five steps 001 occurring For example, the probability of seeing IP 129.173.192.0 is defined to be number of packets using IP 129.173.192.0 divided by the total number of packets in the given time interval A set of 6 aggregate features used in this paper are listed as Table I  is the probability of event X x i 200  Compute entropy of several flow level traffic features collected over each time bin 200  Apply Principal Component Analysis and subspace method to entropy time series 200  Apply time frequency analysis method and Piecewise Aggregate Approximation and Symbolic Aggregate approximation to anomaly time series 200  Apply association rule mining to symbolic sequence 200  Real-time monitoring with valid motif association pattern The first 1,2,3 step is data preprocessing stage, step 4 is data mining stage, step 5 is the outcome of the mining and network traffic monitoring with the valid association rules B  Level of Network Traffic Analysis The network traffic analysis consists of three levels, from bottom to top are packet level, flow level, network-wide level 1  Packet Level Traffic Analysis Each packet including time stamp,IP address or prefix, port number, protocol type bytes and content. IP header information includes traffic volume by IP addresses or protocol, burst of the stream of packets, packet properties \(e.g., sizes, out-of-order\. TCP header information includes traffic breakdown by application e.g., Web\, TCP congestion and flow control, number of bytes and packets per session. Application header information includes URLs, HTTP headers \(e.g., cacheable response DNS queries and responses, user key strokes and so on  2  Flow Level Traffic Analysis Basic information about the flow include source and destination IP address, port number, packet and byte counts, start and end times, ToS, TCP flags. Information related to routing includes next-hop IP address, source and destination AS  3  Network-wide Level Traffic Analysis Network-wide level traffic analysis combines traffic, topology, and state information. Network-wide level traffic analysis is mainly referred to traffic matrix analysis in this paper.

A flow is formally defined as a 5-tuple: source address, destination address, source port, destination port, and type of protocol. We focus on six fields: source address \(sometimes called source IP and denoted srcIP\, destination address \(or destination IP, denoted dstIP source port \(srcPort\, destination port \(dstPort\, octets and type of protocol Entropy is a metric that captures the degree of dispersal or concentration of a distribution.

Principal components analysis \(PCA\ [6 is u s u a lly t h e m ai n me t h o d  ap p lie d  to e x e r t  such function We regard the data points as a cloud with n dimensions and the first main component 1 PC is the direction point with the greatest change 2 PC is the direction points with greatest change which stand on the orthogonal direction of 1 PC This process does not finish until all the main components are discovered, and n refers to the dimensions of data. Please make sure all the main components converge with one another orthogonally, and thus form an orthonormal basis. The data change most on the first number axis direction, while the one on the second axis change less than the first one, and so do the other components The subspace method uses these PCA mentioned above to define the normal subspace and the anomalous   subspace. For some m the normal subspace is the space spanned by 1 PC  through m PC and the abnormal subspace is similarly the space spanned by 1 003  0.67 0.25 0 -0.18 -0.32 -0.43 -0.52 4 003    0.84 0.43 0.18 0 0.14 0.25 5 003     0.97 0.57 0.32 0.14 0 6 003      1.07 0.67 0.43 0.25 7 003       1.15 0.76 0.52 8 003        1.22 0.84 9 003         1.28  004 denote the th i element of the alphabetize a b b a b c  Figure 2  A time series is dispersed by firstly obtaining a PAA approximation and then using predetermined breakpoints to map the PAA coefficients into SAX symbols Note that in this example the 3 symbols, \223a\224, \223b\224 and \223c\224 are approximately equiprobable as we desired. We call the series of symbols representing a subsequence a word A subsequence P with length N can be represented as a word n p p P  1 002  C  Time Series Representation and Time Frequency Analysis 1  Piecewise Aggregate Approximation The basic idea of Piecewise Aggregate Approximation \(PAA\ [7  8   9   i s  th at i t represents the time series as a sequence of rectangle basis functions. It is a dimensionality-reduction representation method in essential as in   005 001 is the basic wavelet function and   1   a t a t a  2 003 003 002 002 212 1 3 The PAA representation is only an intermediate step of obtaining the SAX 3  Wavelets Transform and Wavelet Packet Transform Suppose       2 t R L t x 2 1  212   i N n i N n j j i p n N p 1  1  1  n is the length of sequence N is the number of PAA segments i p is the average value of the th i segment 2  Symbolic Aggregate approximation The basic idea of Symbolic Aggregate approximation \(SAX   s t ha t i t  converts the time series into  an  discrete symbolic sequence Having transformed a time series data into the PAA, we can apply SAX to obtain a discrete symbolic representation. Since normalized time series have a Gaussian distribution, we can determine the \223breakpoints\224 that will produce c equal-sized areas under Gaussian distribution curve [10   The breakpoints will be found out by looking them up in Table II. Once the breakpoints have been obtained we can disperse time series into discrete symbolic series. We firstly obtain a PAA manner of the origin time series. All PAA coefficients that are below the smallest breakpoint are transformed to the symbol \223a\224, and all coefficients greater than or equal to the smallest breakpoint but less than the second smallest breakpoint are transformed to the symbol \223b\224, etc Fig.2 illustrates the idea TABLE II  A  L OOKUP T ABLE T HAT C ONTAINS T HE B REAKPOINTS   c  0 1 003  0.43 -0.67 -0.84 -0.97 -1.07 -1.15 -1.22 -1.28 2 003  0.43 0 -0.25 -0.43 -0.57 -0.67 -0.76 -0.84 3 003  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 10 0.5 004 Then the transformation from a PAA approximation appr P to a word P is obtained as in  iif p j i  004 and b  m PC through   n m PC n 006 005 005 006 212  is the shift and scale extension of the basic wavelet function as in   1

Among all combination, the least entropy is the good basis. The decomposition of good basis can represent the timefrequency of signal which imply that the method is adaptive for signal 4  Choi-Williams Distribution In order to reduce the disturbed components of the Chio-William distribution[11   we should have a research on the factors which make the disturbed value minimum. The Choi-Williams is proposed to solve this problem as in     001 f  t Given an itemset  X we find all the rules Y X r Frequent itemsets is used to generate all frequent itemsets in a given database T Dislike general association rules mining, the time of data point should be focused on when we using time series association rules mining. Each feature elements have different value at each time so we apply association rule mining to different values of different network feature within the same time interval The abrupt changes of different time series at the same time bin usually have a certain motif association pattern. This rule lays the foundation for us to analyze anomalous behavior of large-scale network and predict the network security situation The demo of Multiple Time Series Association Rules Data Mining is showed in the following Fig.3    212  007         1    t t x dt a t t x a a WT a x 006 005 006 4 is called as the wavelet transform of   t x The basic idea of discrete wavelet transform \(DWT\ is to transform a discrete time signal into a discrete wavelet representation. Discrete wavelet transform converts an input series k x x x   1 0 into one high-pass wavelet coefficient series and one low-pass wavelet coefficient series \(of length  2 n each\ given by as in  \(5\  and  \(6  212  212 200  1 0 2   m k k k i i z s x H 5     t y n is called as wavelet packet which is the result of whole decomposition of all bands on various scale of origin signal. Let j n k 2  but the ones in a limited range. When studying the distribution shape of a certain time t\e should study the features of signals near the given time In a sense, it means to condense the cross-item of multivariable signal by adding some windows and deleting the non local components. Finally we change Wigner-Ville distribution into local distribution. Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution characterizes [11 l oc a l be h a vi or of a s i gn a l  a s  the following formula, so it is convenient for us to mine the local features of the fault signals as in  212  212  212  n i In practice, such transformation will be used recursively on the low-pass series until the desired number of iterations is reached Wavelet Packet Transform \(WPT\ is a method which makes time frequency decomposition of signal. WPT is of self-adaptive of signal, which can effectively display the time frequency property of signal. Just by orthogonal mirror filter we can obtain WPT decomposition. Assume the signal   t y  we can obtain       212   007 212 212 n  n 212 n  n 212 8 Wigner-Ville distribution    f t C satisfies the edge conditions and shift characteristics but does not satisfy weak and limited support characteristics.

Hence this rule can be used to identify whether the anomaly is worm or not.

We analyze six time series of entropy value by PCA method, and obtain the time series of the anomalies\222 entropy value In order to locate the anomalies, we apply the wavelet packet transformation, Choi-Williams distribution and Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution methods to anomaly entropy time series.

Discussion  Ordered information table is an important part of Granular Computing. In this thesis, we present a new idea of multiple decisions ordered information tables based on OIT theory, which is used to deal with multiple decisions situations in everyday life. We study the process of discovering multiple decisions OIT rules in detail. This article enriches MDOIT logic expressions and discusses the properties of the meaning sets and ordered rules in MDOIT Furthermore, we introduce mutual information of logic expressions, comparability of attributes and significance of attributes, which are used to direct the MDOIT rules mining and the reduction of OIT An illustrative example of MDOIT rules discovery is also given to interpret the above important definitions and methods. This new thoughts and methods enrich the ordered information tables theory and establish a stability basis for future development of OIT. It is important and useful for people to comprehend the essence of ordered information tables  Acknowledgement This paper is the partial achievement of project 60533040 and 60525202 supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC\, project 2006BAH02A01 supported by the National Key Technology R&D Program of China, and project Z104267 supported by Natural Science Fund of Zhejiang Province  References 1 Sa i, Y Y a o, Y  Y  a nd Z h ong N   D a t a a n a l y s is  a nd mining in ordered information tables Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining San Jose, USA, November 29 - December 2, Cercone, N., Lin T.Y. and Wu, X. \(Eds\, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 497-504 2001  2 Y a o, Y  Y   M in ing h i g h or de r de c i s i on r u le s   Rough Set Theory and Granular Computing Inuiguchi, M., Hirano, S and Tsumoto, S. \(Eds.\, Springer, Berlin, pp. 125-135, 2003   G r eco  S    M a t a razzo  B   an d S l o w i n ski  R Rou gh approximation of a preference relation by dominance relations European Jouranl of Operational Research 117 63-83, 1999  4 Za de h  L  A  T ow a r ds a the o r y o f f u zzy inf o r m a tion granulation and its centrality in human reasoning and fuzzy logic Fuzzy Sets and Systems 19, 111-127, 1997  5 A  hrn, J.
