MATERIALS AND METHODS Jinxin ZHUANG, Weizhen WANG  Jiemin WANG weizhen@lzb.ac.cn  The 5.5 km\3275.5 km experimental area was located in the middle reaches of the Heihe River \(China\which covered across parts of the Yingke and Daman irrigation districts, with land use types of seed cor n, orchards, vegetables and residential area An internal 4.4 km\3274.8 km area was picked out to deploy the observation matrix Within the observation matrix, 17 EC stations \(inc luding one for village installed according to the crop structure windbreak, resident area, soil moisture and irrigation status \(Figure 1 of LAS \(LAS1, LAS2 and LAS3\were deployed at an equal height of 34 m in the center of the matrix with a north-south direction. It was envisaged that the size of the source areas of these three LASs spaned 3\3273 MODIS pixels. In addition another set of LAS \(LAS4\was installed with a north-south direction that covered 1\3272 MODIS pixels. The purpose of building an observation matrix composed by LAS and EC sensors was to measure multi-scale ET After the experiment, post dada processing and qualit y control were very important We adopted the procedure of data-processing widely accepted by the international to insure the quality of data. Figure 2 shows the data processing procedure for EC data All EC data were calculated in this way to assure standard and reliability of the fluxes  As is known, remote sensing retrieves area information while observation obtains point. Therefore the representatives of them, or named scale problems, can\220t be ignored, especially over heterogeneous underlyi ng surface. What matters is how to get an \215areal true value\216 by observations to ver ify the remote sensing retrieval results We carried out a multi-scale observation ca mpaign over heterogeneous surfaces by using an observation matrix composed of ed dy covariance system \(EC\ and large aperture scintillometer \(LAS to estimate the areal information at pixel scale in an oasis. This multi-scale observation experimen t was anticipated to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of evapotranspiration \(ET\a nd its impact factors. Meanwhile, it also can provide multi-scale data sets of meteorological eleme nts and land surface parameters that can facilitate the developm ent of scale methods for estimating regional ET over heterogeneous surfaces  Multi-scale Observation Matrix over Heterogeneous Land Surfaces for Verifying Remote Sensing Results INTRODUCTION E-mail: zhgis@163.com 002\003\004 004\005\003\006\007\006\002\005\004\004\006\007\007\007\002\006\007\b\007\t\b\n\t\007\013\f\f\r\016\017\f\007\t\r\020\021\021\\021 020\022\023\024\025\025\r\017\f\007\t Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China

to a group of queries this cost can be amortized among all queries and thus optimize the overall performance which was illustrated in Fig 1 The experimental results show that even though Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm is worse than no-partition hash join for one single query it outperforms no-partition hash join for a group of queries In addition because it is not sensitive to data skew problem Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm performs better in this case VI CONCLUSION With the advance in hardware technology as well as growing demands for real-time response for database application IMDB becomes the central focus in this eld Because of its architectural advantages NUMA which is designed for multi-core system such that each processor accesses its local memory faster than shared memory effectively solves the memory-access related starvation problem In this paper we propose a Distributed Bitmap Join algorithm which aims at optimizing join one of the most expensive operations in database applications by reducing the communication cost and reusing of intermediate results The comparison with nopartition hash join shows that our method outperforms the competitor in terms of execution time for a group of queries The performance also improves with the increase of overlap ratio of query set This work is partially supported by Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project No B412 National Science Foundation of China under grunt No.61003069 No.61033007 and No.60925008 National 973 program under grant No.2010CB731402 R EFERENCES  S Ne gash Business intelligence

employees and extensive testing of each vehicle dominates launch cost and the series of steps needed for each launch precludes much greater launch productivity than is currently seen To make space launch operations routine and frequent the operation must be brought to an airline-level of repetitiveness and ef\002ciency This means runway-based launchers that can take off and land horizontally In turn this implies airbreathing propulsion for the atmospheric section of the 003ight probably with recapture of oxygen by liquefying air on the way up Development of horizontal takeoff and landing space launchers is hindered by the lack of demand for space launch In turn SSP cannot be deployed without such a capability In the 002nal paper a section will be added on the development of runway-based launchers with estimates of the payload development cost number of launching stations types and number of launchers needed frequency of launches and types of payloads 11 S UMMARY OF N EEDED R ESEARCH AND D EVELOPMENT Several items remain as essential technology development These are brie\003y enumerated below 1  Millimeter wave conversion to and from alternating current continues to be a 002rst-order uncertainty in its ef\002ciency and speci\002c power when applied on a multi-megawatt scale 2  Runway-based space launch especially airbreathing vehicles with liquid air cooled engines 3  High-temperature materials such as Hafnium Carbide and their performance for applications such as that in the blades of the 002rst turbine stage 12 C ONCLUSIONS 1  The speci\002c power for the space-based component of the Space Power Grid architecture for SSP now promises to be above 1.5 kW/kg 2  Miliimeter wave dynamic beaming from 2000 km orbits is seen to provide the expected reduction in system mass over architectures with GEO-based microwave beaming 3  The use of a solar Brayton cycle provides the remaining improvement in speci\002c power due to the favorable scaling of turbomachine system mass with increasing power compared to the linear scaling of photovoltaic architectures 4  Bringing down the Mirasol solar collectors to 2000 km orbits enables better capture of the solar power using the Girasol concentrators 5  The speci\002c power can be further improved using graphene-based radiators 6  The mass budgets speci\002ed in the 2011 version of the SPG

 13 continuity  The weather and climate models used by forecasters and scientists in the United States and throughout the world rely heavily on data from NASA-developed and NOAAoperated polar-orbiting satellites.  The continuity of that data is critical.  Without these satellite observations advance notice of extreme events would be diminished Accurate three to ten day forecasts allow businesses, Federal and state governments, and the American public to prepare for severe weather events, reducing personal injury and death, safeguarding property, live stock and cutting the length of time businesses are shut down.  For example: The path of an anticipated hurricane, its accompanying storm surge, and the coastal flood potential are critical inputs to the decisions necessary to conduct safe and strategic evacuations of coastal residents.  Conversely, inaccurate forecasts can lead to needless and costly evacuations that undermine the public\222s confidence in weather warnings, and ultimately compromise evacuation response in the face of a real emergency.  Further inland, accurate rainfall forecasts are essential to mitigate against flash flooding and mudslides  Data continuity over decades, and across multiple and diverse Earth Science Missions, is providing, for the first time, the ability to look at our planet as a system and to correlate changes within these data sets with observed climate trends.  The NASA Earth Observing System's weather instruments have enabled the first improvement in weather forecasting skill in more than a decade.  Over the last twelve years, instruments on NASA\222s Terra and Aqua satellites have provided the first global measurements of aerosols in our atmosphere, which come from natural sources such as volcanoes and dust storms.  Other instruments onboard the Aura satellite study the processes that regulate the abundance of ozone in the atmosphere Data from the GRACE and ICESat missions, as well as from spaceborne radar, are used to monitor trends in thickness of the Earth\222s polar ice sheets, while the Jason-1 and Jason-2 missions are recording fluctuations in sea level Together, data integrated from all of these missions provide our scientists with a system level view of our planet\222s ecosystems and the interactions impacting weather and climate on a global scale  Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA\ have a mandate under the Clean Air Act to monitor ozone-depleting gases and stratospheric depletion of ozone.  A recent joint study performed by NASA and NOAA has shown that the average area covered by the Antarctic ozone hole in 2012 was the second smallest in the last 20 years, while a study in 2011 showed that the amount of ozone destroyed in the Arctic in 2011 was comparable to that seen in some years in the Antarctic where an ozone "hole" has formed each spring since the mid-1980s  NASA and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer via ground measurements and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s.  Long-term ozone monitoring instruments have included TOMS, SBUV/2 Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment series of instruments, the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, and the Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite \(OMPS\strument on Suomi NPP.  Arctic ozone loss has been measured with daily global observations of trace gases and clouds from NASA's Aura and CALIPSO spacecraft.  Ozone is critical to protect the Earth from harmful radiation, and continuing to develop and fund space instruments to measure ozone is necessary to predict future ozone amounts.  The Decadal Survey included a mission called the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission GACM\ continue this study of ozone  Through the use of continuous data, the United States and partnering nations share, converge on and establish the guidelines necessary to manage their resources, reduce pollutants and continue to give their people the quality of life we all currently enjoy  9  C ONCLUSIONS AND R ECOMMENDATIONS   In 2011 the NRC revisited the Decadal Survey report and published a Midterm Assessment Report.  This report stated 223NASA responded favorably and aggressively to the decadal survey, embracing its overall recommendations for Earth observations, missions, technology investments, and priorities for the underlying science.  As a consequence, the science and applications communities have made significant progress over the past 5 y T h i s paper s u mm ari zed  the foundation missions which were in place at the time of the Decadal Survey and the cooperative science realized by flying these satellites in coordinated mission orbits known as the A Train and Morning Constellations. It discussed the systematic way NASA identified the science observations necessary to address the full range of Earth Science questions, and the importance of maintaining scientific breadth.  It presented the new paradigm of developing instruments through multiple programs and decoupling that development from the eventual assembly of instruments and spacecraft to form a mission.  It stressed that for NASA to achieve the goal of developing and flying the missions defined in the Decadal Survey there must be continued funding, available, appropriately sized launch vehicles and a strong supplier base.   The consequences of not having these key elements are a gap in data continuity and a delay in answering the key Earth science questions involved in basic Earth stewardship  Within the next couple of years it is expected that there will be another Decadal Survey.  Given the budget outlook for Earth Science and NASA, there should be a recommendation to shrink the size of the instruments as much as possible while still gaining valuable observations 


 14 Then, recognizing that flying smaller payloads on traditional launch vehicles will be very wasteful, there should be a recommendation to encourage th e efforts that have been started to utilize non-traditional methods of launching instruments including hosting them on commercial satellites, combining them into larger missions that fill the launch vehicle, or sharing rides to space \226 all concepts designed to match up the size of the payload with the size of the launch vehicle.  Lastly, some consideration should be given to the on-orbit architecture of the next generation of missions \226 should they be organized into coordinated orbits such as the Afternoon Constellation and the Morning Constellation, or be put into individual orbits that maximize specific science observations, as the Tier 1 and 2 missions are doing?  Are there other constellation architectures to be explored?  Despite a steady or declining budget outlook, a future with smaller, nimble satellites sharing launch vehicles and cooperating via newly developed constellation architectures could yield a very exciting future for Earth Science  Acknowledgements 227 George Andrew, John Carey, Pete Cline, Ed Hatter, and Carey Lively provided valuable contributions in the writing of this paper  R EFERENCES   1  NASA 2010 Science Plan for NASA\222s Science Mission Directorate NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C    C o u r tes y of Dr. Ste v en P l at n i c k N A S A GS FC  3  Earth Science and Applications from Space National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond The National Academies Press, Washington D.C., 2007  4  Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Midterm Assessment of NASA's Implementation of the Decadal Survey The National Academies Press Washington D.C., 2012   C E N R  I WG EO  2005 Strategic Plan for the U.
