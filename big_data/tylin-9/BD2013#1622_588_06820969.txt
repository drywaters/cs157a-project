Abstract 
Cloud computing has already been adopted in a broad range of application domains and has become an established building block in IT landscapes During the process of cloud middleware development the companies have focused mainly on the high availability of data and end-user services but unfortunately neglected the availability of middleware components Therefore failures of the middleware components itself usually leads to a partial or even total blackout of the cloud In this paper we present the design and implementation of a novel scalable and highly available multi-master pattern for cloud 
middlewares In contrast to existing Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud management frameworks which are usually designed in a centralized tree topology composed in a three-tiered masterworker architecture we introduce a concept for a multi tree with all tree roots connected in a fully connected mesh topology In this architecture user requests are load balanced over multiple failover servers Furthermore our concept includes an automatic self-healing mechanism for worker nodes of each tree 
I I NTRODUCTION Running applications in the cloud on a large number of shared-nothing commodity computers makes fault tolerance an important issue Not only the higher error-proneness of the hardware compared to high availability hardware but also the larger number of those easier failing components leads to a high failure probability Therefore failure prevention in Cloud Computing has become a well discussed topic in the last years and is differentiated in several types power failures network failures server failures and management software failures Especially on the Infrastructure-as-a-Service IaaS layer fault tolerance is an important issue because failures in this layer result in poor quality of services Depending on the application running on the infrastructure a poor quality of service may be for example data loss or a long off time of a virtual 
In this level a failure is a crashed VM which results in data loss if no suitable replication mechanisms is applied 
machine For IaaS providers it is highly important to prevent failures or at least recover from failures transparent to the user and as fast as possible At the same time the solution should be feasible without special hardware or complex changes in the cloud infrastructure The described approaches in this paper are based on our cloud middleware called CloudDisco CloudDisco is b uild similar to the known IaaS platforms like Eucalyptus or OpenStack In contrast it is designed to offer physical and virtual hardware through the internet These hardware components are virtualized physical hardware elements which can be shared in the cloud and enable applications or virtual machines the access to geographical distributed hardware devices The availability of the hardware components is crucial for the quality of services in CloudDisco Nevertheless the quality of service in IaaS clouds is based on the management software as well Thus we focus on Management Software Failures in this paper which can be subdivided in the following three levels Virtual Machine Level Cluster Level 
  
An error in this level is most severe because it results in an unavailability of the entire cloud Common Iaas middleware they are typically built in a three-tier master-worker architecture depicted in gure 1 The single master instance is the cloud interface it is called or  This interface between the cloud environment and a user client is a signiìcant component which should not only provide high availability support but also scalability mechanisms to achieve quality of service requirements the described approach can be adapted to these systems In CloudDisco the is the interface for the user to request a list of available hardware as well as to setup the connection to one of the hardware components The receiving a request for all available hardware components sent it to all connected  The

to the  which passes it back to the user If the gets unavailable the whole service becomes unavailable even though the and thus the hardware components are still available Similarly in Eucalyptus for

information In such a architecture a failure of the is an error in the and will lead to an outage of the entire cloud On the other hand a failure in a is an error in the and will affect only an individual part of the cloud In the further course of this text we will restrict ourselves to the naming of CloudDisco components as is equivalent to in Eucalyptus Besides the and the have the same names in Eucalyptus In OpenStack the components are called nova-api nova-scheduler and nova-compute Note that the mentioned components have similar or even equal functions within the cloud system and the architectures are alike Therefore the pattern described in this paper can also be adapted to any other IaaS platform or any other platform of that kind Cloud Manager Cloud Controller nova-api Cluster Controller Cluster Controller nova-scheduler Node Controller Node Controller nova-compute As the main beneìt of the numerous computing nodes is the ability to parallelize applications a failed machine usually leads to a lose of information This information might be crucial to the functionality of the application or the completeness of the results In order to achieve fault tolerance it is necessary to make this information available to the system again Depending on the application there are several approaches for this issue like replication in DDBMS or sa ving of intermediate data in parallel processing systems like MapReduce In this paper we describe a technique to deal with machine failures in a multimaster cloud The substantial disadvantage of the common architectures is the non redundant structure which cause each component to be a single point of failure though on a different impact level Especially failure of the single master node would cause a entire blackout of the system Nevertheless a failing Cluster Controller would make a part of the Cloud unavailable To prevent a partial or even an entire blackout of the cloud we introduce an architecture for a load balanced multimaster system in cloud middlewares Due to the multiple  an entire blackout of the cloud and thus failures in the are more improbable because all other master nodes can take over the work of a failed node Additionally the approach handles several master failures because it is based on independent multiple installation where each master instance is a further failover server Therefore the cloud would still be available as long as one master server is still alive Besides the advantages of the higher availability due to the multi-master architecture scalability issues are solved with this approach As their are multiple master nodes available the user requests can be distributed over all available master nodes Furthermore the multi-master architecture described in this paper does not only prevent failures due to high availability and load distribution but can also recover from failures with an self healing mechanism When some fail and the lose the connection to the cloud management interface a self-healing of the cloud middleware is initiated automatically The self-healing accomplishes a reconnection of the  Thus the cloud resources are still available after a crashed since the are remigrated by using another failover instance Thereby a failure in the can be eliminated Moreover the reconnection attempts of multiple are load-balanced between all residual in order to avoid inherited error and to raise the performance The rest of this paper is organized as follows section II discusses related work in this area and will show the differences to other approaches Section III describes the idea and implementation of the failover pattern in detail The section IV explains how the self-healing is processed and in section V we conclude our results II R ELATED W ORK The importance for failover mechanism was also recognized by the developers of Eucalyptus The CTO and cofounder of Eucalyptus Systems Inc Rich Wolski has noted in  that the y will focus more on enterprise-quality features e.g to dev elop a high-availability version of Eucalyptus that provides hot failover of internal components in the platform Shortly thereafter the rst release of Eucalyptus Cloud 3.0 with high availability support has been published in February 2012 The concept of Eucalyptus for high availability is to have primary and secondary cloud and cluster components The primary component works in the same fashion as described above but if a failure occurs the secondary component becomes the primary component The technology behind this failover technique is a service called  which approximates reachability to a user by monitoring the connectivity between a user and the internal components This monitoring is performed by sending messages to an external entity or an external site periodically The primary/secondary server relationship of the Eucalyptus concept for high availability has some disadvantages If the primary server goes down all user requests need to be redirected to the secondary instance and an administrator is obligated to repair or restart the primary node During this time the cloud installation is executed in the traditional way with only one management instance as a single point of failure and if a further error occurs the whole cloud would be no longer available Moreover the primary/secondary approach does not solve the problem of scalability because there is only one interface instance to the cloud at any time Another approach had been presented by Jamilson Dantas who used the same principle of a primary and a secondary component with Eucalyptus in b ut b undles the

   and on a single machine which he called the GA By continuously monitoring and synchronization between the primary GA and the secondary GA he simulates in his evaluation with the aid of a Markov Reward Model a fast switch over in an error case This approach has the same disadvantages as described above for the current Eucalyptus version with high availability support Additional the beneìts of an faster switchover are irrelevant because in an error case not only the interface to the cloud would be affected but also additional components of the installation OpenNebula promotes a methodology called as part of their fault tolerance feature ho we v er  if the OpenNebula daemon crashes due to an error the entire cloud is affected and can only be reactivated by an intervention of an administrator In contrast to the high availability principle for cloud platforms described above many cloud middleware developer concentrate their work only on high availability for storage and virtual machines 12 13 14 In this conte xt checkpointing is another well known general technique to improve fault tolerance of a computer system Whereas checkpointing can be either writing an applicationês processing data to disk or to snapshot a virtual machine In case of a f ailure a backup node can take over the failed nodes work by using the checkpoint There are several approaches of optimization of checkpointing in this area Zhou et al introduce a method to mirror machine memory to a virtual memory were it can be used in case of a restart Singh et al inte grate a checkpointing algorithm into the load balancing to make the checkpointing more efìcient W alters et al using checkpointing for MPI computations in HPC environments  Ho we v er  checkpointing cannot be used to impro v e the availability of cloud middlewares because the correction of errors is very time consuming and additional components are also required to create and store the checkpoints The work of Eugen Feller et al is the most closest to our approach In the authors present a virtual machine management framework called Snooze which is built on top of Apache ZooKeeper and prevent the single point of failure by a self-organization and self-healing mechanism Snoozeês architecture is similar to the common architecture of gure 1 though they call the the  and the  The principle that they pursue is a fusion of and  In particular the instance can have two states either it runs in the mode or in the mode If an error occurs at one of these components an event is triggered This event is followed by an election algorithm in which a new will be elected by a given identiìer During this reorganization the which will be the new terminates all its tasks and all connections to the underlying  After that all need to rejoin the network and need to establish new connections to another  This approach improves the availability of the middleware but does not solve the scalability problem because at any time only a single is elected to provide its functionalities for upper layer requests and all its  In contrast to this approach the multi-master architecture in our middleware more is exible and improves not only the availability of all middleware components but also the scalability of the interface to the cloud Furthermore in our approach it is unnecessary to terminate all connections to the underlying components This avoids time-consuming rejoining of already connected  III F AILOVER P ATTERN The pattern described in this paper is based on a three tier multi-master cloud and is the foundation for communication in the middleware layer of our ongoing research project CloudDisco The major difference to the traditional masterworker pattern is that there are multiple equal master nodes as depicted in gure 2 In contrast to a master-slave architecture the different master nodes are not passive replicas of an active master but are active nodes and in charge of a fraction of the cloud These master nodes called CM are interconnected in a full-mesh topology and can communicate with each other Each worker node called CC is connected to exactly one of the master nodes which announces and updates a list of all known CMs in the system Since all CMs are equal a user as well as a CC can connect to any CM of the cloud CCs do not have any knowledge of each other.They are connected to at least one resource provider  NC In our model the connection between the components is setup from the NC to the CC and from the CC to the CM If a new NC was started the instance registers itself at a given CC which it has been assigned to The CC controls a speciìc cluster of several NCs which had been bundled due to the locality or characteristics of the NCs A new CC in turn registers itself at one of the existing CMs it does not matter to which CM the CC connects because all CMs are equal multimaster nodes and act as a unit Thus the components build a tree with one CM as the root node which is in turn connected to all other CMs of the cloud Therefore the overlay network consists of a mixture between a tree topology and a fullmesh topology Figure 2 depicts such an installation with four CMs and a user who requests the rst instance In this gure an schematic architecture is displayed where the transparent colored components represent variety of nodes and additional underlying components A new CM has to know at least one other master node During start up it connects to a CM and receives a list of all other master nodes in the system It will then establish a connection to every CM in this list Each CM receiving a connection attempt updates its list of known master nodes and propagates the updated list to its connected CCs Such a mechanism guarantees consistency of interconnected cloud components and enables a failover technique in case of a CM crash This way an entire cloud blackout is prevented because the user has another CM available at any time The task of the worker nodes is to collect and aggregate the information of the connected information providers when it is asked by its master node The master nodes get requests from users and collect the requested information from its connected workers and request all other master nodes to start collecting from their workers The original master node receives all information aggregates it and gives it to the user

The is the interface to the cloud This interface enables various functionalities e.g to list all available resources to reserve a time slot for a resource or to use a resource in the desired manner For each of these functionalities the user submits a request over a client or directly by using the web interface of a CM This request results in a job that the CM needs to process Therefore the CM creates a session for this job and needs to specify an appropriate addressing methodology according to the type of the job The addressing methodology can be either an unicast or a multicast If the user requests a list of all available resources for example this job needs to be propagated to all CCs and results in a multicast message In contrast a job for a speciìc NC is only transmitted to the corresponding CC by an unicast message The messages which are sent in the overlay network are called A is sent to all connected CCs and CMs in case of a multicast If the is related to a directly connected CC it is sent only to the corresponding CC If the CC is not part of the CMês bunch the is sent to all CMs in the toplevel mesh Depending on the afìliation of the message the CMs decide to either reject or forward the  Hence if a is sent to a CC in another tree over a CM this CM acts as a router for such a  Each CC waits for incoming and when it receives one the associated job is executed e.g collecting data from the underlying  The result is than transmitted back to the connected CM in a new  If the CM is the same which emitted the  it collects and aggregates the information and gives it to the user In any other case the CM operates as a router again and transmits the to the source CM These addressing technique requires additional information which are speciìed in a header of each  This header includes beside the source and destination address of the components a session identiìer which enables the assignment of a to a corresponding job or request The interconnection between CM instances is based on a peer-to-peer overlay network In Particular all CMs are fully connected by the full-mesh topology which is the most redundant and reliable network but is not feasible for a large number of peers We opted for this topology because rstly the computationally intensive work is been done by the CCs which results in a rather smaller number of CMs compared to the well known master-worker pattern And secondly which have been sent between CMs are only routed to the directly connected CCs or immediately rejected Therefore can only be executed by the direct neighbor peers which results in a maximum hop distance of one The scalability is one of the basic principles of the cloud therefore the cloud should not only enable the scalability for resources but should also be able to scale itself Adding and removing Cloud Manager and Cluster Controllers must be possible in a cloud system Otherwise the capacity of a CM could be exceeded due to the number of connected CCs or the number of user requests and the limit for a qualitative response time can no longer be guaranteed On the other hand running CMs with spare capacity is causing waste of money For that reason according to the number of users and the current workload the number of available CMs can be increased or decreased When a new CM is added to the cloud it establishes connections to all CMs in the existing cloud The details of the connection establishment is describte in Subsection III-C Removing a CM from the cloud is similar to the self healing machanism All connected CCs of this node have to be connected to other CMs in the cloud The details of the self healing mechanism are described in Section IV In contrast to the self healing mechanism during the removal process the CM is able to wait for all pending user requests to be nished until all connected CCs have been reconnected In order to provide load balancing between the CMs the Round Robin DNS RR-DNS load balancing technique is used to distribute the requests of users over all available CMs

C Communication establishment A Failover list distribution 
In order to build such an overlay network for high available cloud middleware components an initial CM needs to be instantiated rst In order to secure the cloud system it is necessary to make sure that no unpermitted server connects to the mesh Additionally the communication itself must be secured This can be done in various ways as the security is not the main focus of this work at this point the mesh is only secured with a simple password technique which is brieîy described within this chapter for the sake of completeness This CM is the initial node where a password for the mesh is set This password is necessary to protect the overlay multimaster mesh against unauthorized access When the initial node has been successful started every other node no matter if the node is a CC or a CM can be started by assigning an IPAddress of any already running CM and the initially deìned password If a new CC is instantiated to join the cloud environment a connection between the CC and a CM needs to be established The gure 3 depicts a sequence diagram for a connection establishment between a CM and a CC The rst message is sent from the CC to the CM because each connection must be made in the direction of a CM The rst message is the authentication message which is the symmetrically encrypted IP address of the CC The symmetric key for the encryption was generated from the initially deìned password for the mesh At the CM site the encrypted IP address is decrypted and compared to the given IP address of the new node If both IP addresses correspond to each other the connection to the new component is permitted This authentication scheme does not only prevent most man-in-the-middle attack strategies but enables also an encrypted data exchange during the continuing communication When the access to the overlay network is granted the CM sends an announcement message back which contains a list of all available and interconnected CMs in the multi-master mesh This list represents all possible failover servers which the CC can use for the self-healing mechanism described in section IV In the last message of the three way handshake the CC signalizes the CM its readiness for work by sending a status message This message simply consists of the number of NCs which are currently connected to the CC During the  When a CM extends or leaves the overlay multi-master mesh the list of possible failover servers needs to be updated 
Fig 3 Connection establishment between CC and CM connection setup this number is just the information for the receivers that the CM is ready It is discarded at this point However this number gives valuable information If the value is equal to zero it indicates a newly instantiated CC In turn a number greater than zero means that the node is running a long time and due to an error the CC is rejoining the overlay network On the other hand there is the case that a new CM is instantiated to extend the multi-master mesh as a further failover server or reconnecting after a failure In order to connect to the mesh the CM rst of all connects to one of the CMs in the mesh The connection establishment between a CM and another CM which is already part of the mesh follows the same principle of the three way handshake In contrast to the message exchange above the new CM interprets the announcement message as a list of mesh nodes it needs to connect to next In particular the new CM creates a new connection to each of the mesh nodes and this way initiates a self-registration in the failover lists of each master and an update process where all CMs distribute new failover lists to their CCs During the connection establishment to the other master nodes the three way handshake is performed for every connection This enables an overall comparison of all failover lists to check the consistency of the multi-master mesh If an inconsistency is detected an overall list update between the CMs is initiated IV S ELF H EALING All cloud components the CMs the CCs as well as the NCs are interconnected by TCP/IP sockets Thus an interrupted connection can be identiìed and is interpreted as a failure of the connected component Note that a slow connection to a CM is considered to be a failure too In the context of CloudDisco there is a limit for a qualitative response time Therefore a slow connection is treated as failure too In case of a failed CM the corresponding CCs and the other CMs lose the connection and therefore become aware of the failure The other CMs will then update their list of known CM nodes and pass it to their connected CCs As the CC is no longer connected to a master node it has to establish a new connection to another CM Therefore the relevant CCs start the self-healing phase by reconnection attempts to the next failover server In particular each CC tries to connect to the rst CM in its failover list If the connection establishment to this CM fails it tries to connect to the next CM in its failover list As described in III-C the connection attempt is done by a three way handshake analogous to the initial connection setup Figure 4 shows the reconnection of two CCs from a failed CM to new CMs To simplify the gure we leave out the connected NCs at the CCs nevertheless their might be various numbers of NCs connected to each CC If the reconnection can be established each CC has received a new failover list from its new CM during the connection setup and will stay connected to this CM even if the previous CM will be available again

Fig 4 Schematic self-healing in the failover pattern and distributed over all CCs This list is sent from each CM to its currently connected CCs If a CM fails every connected CC will try to establish a new connection to the rst available CM in the failover list Hence if each CC would get the same failover list all CCs would try to connect to the same CM at the same time To avoid this situation the CMs transmit different failover lists to their connected CCs In the following we will describe the list sorting and distribution in a formal manner Every

a common set of requirements for a new science database system which is named SciDB In recent years techniques in traditional databases have been integrated into scientiìc datasets The inde xing scheme is a representati v e e xample In 10 the authors de v eloped the F astBit system to pro vide a set of compressed bitmap indexes Various research efforts have been carried out to optimize queries over the scientiìc dataset In the authors designed tools to support user deìned subsetting and aggregation over NetCDF datasets In their system the query results are aggregated on the server side before returning to the process which reduces the data transfer cost In this research we propose and study a fast data analysis approach with integrated statistical metadata The proposed approach has a similar idea to the indexing scheme but is lightweight and incurs signiìcantly less storage overhead when compared to the indexing schemes In addition the FASM approach complements existing database techniques that are already adopted for scientiìc datasets An even better performance is expected when they are combined together The ADIOS also demonstrates that integrating the statistical metadata could potentially improve the performance 1 Ho we v e r  the current ADIOS only supports collecting local simple statistical and/or analytical data during the output operation for use in identifying desired datasets The FASM system provides the mechanism of integrating the statistical metadata during the initial write In addition this metadata can be further utilized This research has studied various subsetting schemes and the impact on performance as well Parallel netCDF PnetCDF is a library that provides highperformance I/O while maintaining le-format compatibility with Unidataês NetCDF Our F ASM system is prototyped based on PnetCDF currently All these work have shown the importance of scientiìc datasets and data management libraries In this study we propose an approach to subsetting dataset and integrating with statistics Our study complements these existing datasets and libraries and can be helpful to many data-intensive applications VI CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Scientiìc datasets are used in many data-intensive computing elds such as climate modeling high-energy physics astrophysics computational chemistry computational biology medicine discovery etc Research efforts have started integrating modern database techniques and parallel I/O into the management of scientiìc datasets In this work we proposed a new idea of adding statistical metadata into the datasets The statistical metadata illustrates the data distribution features therefore the parallel access code can utilize this metadata to perform fast queries and data analysis Through experimental tests and evaluations we have shown how the integrated statistical metadata improves the query and analysis performance We have also analyzed the impact of various subsetting schemes statistics generating scalability and overhead The evaluation results have indicated that the FASM approach is promising and can be beneìcial to many data-intensive scientiìc applications In the near future we will investigate further to support data modiìcations resubsetting and regeneration of statistics in the FASM at runtime We will study the feasibility of automatic selection of statistics

In addition we also explicitly computed the max-min fair ow bandwidths for these trafìc proìles using the water-ìlling algorithm W e compared the resulting aggre gate throughput to those reported by the simulator For all evaluated trafìc patterns the simulator throughput was within 10 of those reported by the maxmin validator This small difference is because the TCPês AIMD congestion control mechanism only yields approximate max-min fairness in ow bandwidths whereas the validator computes a perfectly max-min fair distribution 6.2 HyperX Networks We rst evaluate Dahu with HyperX networks which have many paths of differing lengths between any source and destination We simulate a  L 3 S 14 T 48 HyperX network with 1Gbps links as described in This models a lar ge data center with 131,712 servers interconnected by 2,744 switches and an oversubscription ratio of 1:8 We seek to measure how Dahuês non-minimal routing and load balancing affect performance as we vary trafìc patterns the maximum derouting threshold and non-minimal routing scheme constrained or not We run simulations with Clique and Mixed trafìc patterns described next and compare the throughput average hop count and link utilizations for Dahu and ECMP In the graphs Dahun refers to Dahu routing with at most n deroutings C-Dahun refers to the similar Constrained Dahu routing variant 6.2.1 Clique Trafìc Pattern A Clique is a subset of switches and associated hosts that communicate among themselves each host communicates with every other host in its clique over time This represents distributed jobs in a data center which are usually run on a subset of the server pool A typical job runs on a few racks of servers There could be multiple cliques or jobs running in different parts of the network We parameterize this trafìc pattern by i clique size the number of switches in the clique and ii total number of cliques in the network In this experiment we vary the total number of cliques from 64 to 768 keeping the clique size xed at 2 switches 96 servers Each source switch in a clique generates 18Gbps of trafìc with 1.5 MB average ow size  Figure 8 Throughput gain with Clique trafìc pattern Bandwidth Figure 8 shows the bandwidth gains with Dahu relative to ECMP as we vary the number of communicating cliques Dahu offers substantial gains of 400-500 over ECMP The performance gain is highest with a smaller number of cliques showing that indeed derouting and non-shortest path forwarding can effectively take advantage of excess bandwidth in HyperX networks a Average hop count         b Link utilization number of cliques  512 Figure 9 Average hop count and link utilization for Clique trafìc pattern with different routing schemes This validates a major goal of this work which is improving the statistical multiplexing of bandwidth in direct network topologies As the number of cliques increases the bandwidth slack in the network decreases and the relative beneìt of non-minimal routing comes down to around 250 Dahu and constrained Dahu have similar performance for the same derouting threshold We further nd that a large derouting threshold provides larger beneìt with less load since there are many unused links in the network As load increases links are more utilized on average bandwidth slack reduces and a derouting threshold of one starts performing better Hop count Beyond raw throughput latency in an important performance metric that is related to network hop count Figure 9a shows the average hop count for each routing scheme Dahu delivers signiìcantly higher bandwidth with a small increase in average hop count Average hop count increases with increase in derouting threshold For smaller derouting threshold the hop count is similar to that of ECMP while still achieving most of the bandwidth improvements of non-minimal routing Note that the small error bars indicate that the average hop count is similar while varying the number of cliques Link utilization Figure 9b shows the CDF of inter-switch link utilizations for ECMP and Dahu for the experiment with 512 cliques With shortest path routing 90 of the links have zero utilization whereas Dahu achieves its bandwidth gains by utilizing available capacity on additional links in the network Also we see that a single derouting can achieve most of the overall bandwidth gains while consuming bandwidth on signiìcantly fewer links in the network thereby sparing network capacity for more trafìc 67

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
