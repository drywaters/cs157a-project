Figure 1 A collaborative planning scenario in business data and its corresponding data structures The term datacentric has multiple meanings in reference to where data lives which could mean same location same machine or the same memory space in different contexts By de  nition in-place computing is data-cen tric computing as well as inmemory computing but not vice versa 64-bit architecture is the key to making in-placing computing technology meaningful and effective While 2 32 is quite limited 2 64 is considerably unlimited in the sense that a 64-bit address space is large enough to hold the big data in most cases that we see today With in-place computing in 64-bit address space it becomes possible for today’s commodity machines to deliver performance approaching the hardware limit i.e giga-operations per second and scalability for the data size growing beyond the swap space size of the running machine Due to the high valence of datasets the collaborative planning problem is best addressed with in-place computing in a single machine in order to avoid the high cost of data shuf  ing among multiple machines However we do not wish to over-promise the capability of the technology When used in cohesion with a single commodity machine it is impractical to handle high terabytes or petabytes of data within a reasonable timeframe It is our planned work in the future to investigate the distributed in-place computing model in order to process data at that scale Our experiments show that one hundred millions of sales records in collaborative planning can be computed in a few seconds simply using one core one CPU one machine with 64GB RAM We aim to compute one billion of records of data in seconds on a commodity m achine equipped with multiple CPU’s and multiple cores II R EAL W ORLD P ROBLEM R EAL T IME C OLLABORATIVE P LANNING We have faced challenges for supply chain planning in China which is a large yet expansively developing country with a very complicated market environment due to various and diverse cultures climate conditions living styles and the ways people conduct business across the country To be re:$2,100 B2:$1,100 C2:$400 C1:$700  B1:$1,000 C2:$500 C1:$500 2,100 C2:$900 B2:$400 B1:$500 C1:$1,200 B2:$700 B1:$500 P1:$500  P2:$500 P3:$700 P4:$400 Figure 2 Two views based on the actual sales data in the previous year 2,300 B2:$1,300 C2:$500 C1:$800  B1:$1,000 C2:$600 C1:$400 2,300 C2:$1,100 B2:$500 B1:$600 C1:$1,200 B2:$800 B1:$400 P1:$400  P2:$600 P3:$800 P4:$500 Figure 3 Two views based on the forecasted sales data sponsive to the market an enterprise needs to deal with rapidly changing demand-supply situations all year long and therefore requires its demand chain partners i.e channels and supply chain partners i.e suppliers to work closely and collaboratively to react to market changes It is important to understand the market trends project future demand and ensure that the supply can meet the demand The demand/supply planning used to be an annual or semi-annual activity conducted solely by executives has now become a daily activity collectively achieved by both executives and middle-level managers The business goal of such large-scale collaborative planning is to reach a consensus for sales forecasting Let us consider the collaborative planning problem as a game played by a set of participants i.e players who act and react on shared data i.e game board according to a set of rules i.e game rules to determine the legitimate actions and states and collect ively achieve a common goal The complexity of a collaborative planning is determined by the number of participants the size of shared data and the degree of interdependencies among data As an actual scenario of a real world collaborative planning application a brand manufacturer with about 200,000 product items product dimension and around 10,000 stores channel dimension plans the demand and supply based on the sales forecasting of the next 52 weeks and the historical sales from the past two years Each product has a unique ID and many attributes such as category sub-category brand color material etc Each store also has a unique ID and many attributes area city type etc The planning process includes many different manager roles such as the product manager category manager sal es manager area manager and brand manager as well as different types of sales data Fig 1 illustrates a collaborative planning game where all managers share forecasted sales data in different hierarchical views Managers both executives and middle-level managers can view and update the data under their roles

after raising the value of B1 in the left view Alerts are raised for exceptions shown in boxed nodes ASimpli  ed Planning Example To illustrate how to perform a collaborative planning process we present a simpli  ed example with 1 two managers brand manager and category manager and 2 two datasets actual sales data from the previous year and forecasted sales data Assume four products P1 P2 P3 and P4 where P1 P2 belong to brand B1 and P3 P4 belong to brand B2 while P1 P3 are of category C1 and P2 P4 are of category C2 The business goal of the collaborative planning process is for the brand manager and the category manager to reach a consensus for sales forecasting and discover if any forecasted sales for product brand or category goes beyond expectation Fig 2 shows two views based on the actual sales dataset i.e P1 P2 P3 and P4 are shared Fig 3 shows two views based on the forecasted sales dataset i.e P1 P2 P3 and P4 are shared The brand manager is interested in both views on the left showing the actual and forecasted sales data grouped by the product’s brand  rst and then by the product’s category That is the hierarchy of the left views is in a top-down order of brand and category  Meanwhile the category manager is interested in both views on the right showing the actual and forecasted sales data grouped by the product’s category  rst and then by the product’s brand That is the hierarchy of the right views is in a top-down order of category and brand  Sales numbers shown in this example are all in thousands of dollars The value at each leaf node is the actual or forecasted sales amount for a product and the value at each intermediate node is the actual or forecasted sales amount for a brand or a category Both the brand manager and category manager are interested to know if any forecasted sales product brand or category is deviated from the actual sales in the previous year by 30 They wish to be noti  ed when such exceptions are caught Expecting the sales of brand B1 to rise 50 in reaction to an advertising campaign the brand manager updates the forecasted sales of B1 from 1 million to 1.5 million dollars as seen in the left view of Fig 4 This update will immediately affect the forecasted sales for every product that belongs to B1 every category and the total sales The changes will be propagated through the views in Fig 4 as follows 1 Left View Upward The total forecasted sales at root node is changed to 2.8 million from 2.3 million 2 Left View Downward By proportion the sales of C1 is changed to 600 thousands from 400 thousands and the value of C2 is changed to 900 thousands from 600 thousands respectively Next the sales of P1 is changed to 600 thousands from 400 thousands and the value of P2 is changed to 900 thousands from 600 thousands respectively 3 Right View Upward The sales of B1 under C1 is changed to 600 thousands from 400 thousands and the value of B1 under C2 is changed to 900 thousands from 600 thousands respectively Next the sales of C1 is changed to 1,400 thousands from 1,200 thousands and the value of C2 is changed to 1,400 thousands from 1,100 thousands respectively Finally the total sales root node is changed to 2.8 million from 2.3 million 4 Left View Exceptions The total sales the sales of B1 the sales of C2 under B1 and the sales of P2 are deviated from the actual sales Fig 2 by 30 They are shown in boxed nodes 5 Right View Exceptions The total sales and the sales of B1 under C2 are deviated from the actual sales Fig 2 by 30 They are shown in boxed nodes Although the above scenario looks simple the computation is complex and time-consuming when the volume of data is huge and a considerable number of participants are involved It is a challenging task to design a collaborative planning application with real-time response Collaborative Planning Application Let us return to the game model of collaborative planning of supply chains The planning game is conducted by having different mangers share and adju st weekly forecasted data from different viewpoints In our application the sales manager sees a view with a hierarchy in the order of area city store category sub-category brand and product while the product manager sees a view with a hierarchy in the order of category sub-category brand product area city and store A category manager or a brand manager who reports to the product manager sees a partial view of what the product manager sees and an area manager who reports to the sales manager sees a partial view of what the sales manager sees However no matter what views they see all of them share the same product-store data for both act ual sales and forecasted sales which are located at the leaf nodes of the view hierarchies The sales manager and product manager have options to create or change a view hierarchy by adding removing or switching attributes There are three major types of computing operations in our planning application described as follows  Aggregation The data values of intermediate nodes in a hierarchy are determined by an aggregation rule which is not necessarily the summation function When a view is created the data values of intermediate nodes will be calculated based on an aggregation rule upward starting from the leaf nodes When a data value is changed either at a leaf node or at an intermediate node all intermediate nodes above the changed node will be recalculated automatically 


 Distribution Besides aggregation when a manager changes the data value at an intermediate node or the root node the system will automatically distribute the changes downward the hierarchy according to a distribution rule e.g even distribution proportional distribution or weighted distribution Once the changes are distributed to the leaf nodes the system will automatically trigger the aggregation process for all view hierarchies that share the same product-store data at the leaf level The distribution process is not applied to actual sales data since they are historical and irreversible  Exception Detection While facing a large amount of data in a hierarchy it is very dif  cult for a manager to examine data in the hierarchy manually It is helpful for managers to set up a set of exception criteria rules which describe whether the data patterns or relations go beyond their expectation These exception criteria rules will be triggered to check against the data once distribution and aggregation operations are completed The managers expect the system to catch exceptions in real time and raise alerts For example the sales manager wishes to be alerted for forecast accuracy exceptions when the actual sales is deviated from the forecasted one for some percentage Based on the exception criteria formula the application will compare the forecasted data against the actual sales and r aise necessary exceptions Challenges A collaborative planning application can be designed based on the traditional computing model However it is impractical to build such a planning application with reasonable response time The challenges are listed below  Large Data Movement The operations aggregation distribution and exception detection require access to the entire tables of actual sales and forecasted sales Retrieving large size of data from the database will take excessive I/O and network overhead  Bounded Virtual Memory Even the 64-bit address space is considerably unlimited the virtual memory that can be allocated from the heap space in a program is bounded to the size of swap space It is not scalable without adding more RAM or increasing the swap space  Paging Anomaly The main-memory data structures allocated from the heap space to hold retrieved data are also in virtual memory which are subject to swapping It is possible that swapping occurs immediately after data is retrieved from the database into memory leading to severe I/O performance problems  Large Data Update Both distribution and exception detection operations require large data update in a database resulting in severe performance problems SQL update and insert are expensive operations  Juggling Being aware of memory space too small to  t all data at once application developers are forced to design algorithms i.e out-of-core or external-memory TABLE I M Y SQL GROUP BY/ROLLUP T IME  Records 1M 5M 10M 50M 100M Time 6.03 36.12 72.86 549.92 1520.64 TABLE II M Y SQL UPDATE T IME  Records 1M 5M 10M 50M 100M Time 11.25 61.91 128.83 677.06 1353.50 algorithms 7 t o proces s d at a w i t h s m al l a mount of memory and later merge the results  Relationality It is common to spend a lot of time and effort tuning relational datab ases for big-data analyticstype applications which often need to scan through a large portion of data from several tables Relational databases are not reliable in terms of consistent performance Performance could be further degraded due to compound SQL statements or large multi-way joins The recent development of NoSQL  is to addres s s uch performance issues Relational database designers understood the performance issues of large data movement and have supported stored procedures as well as some built-in functions to run inside the database servers Simple aggregation operation such as summation can be implemented using SQL ROLLUP 11 operator To have an idea of how relational databases perform we conducted experiments with SQL ROLLUP operator using several open-source databases Since all tested databases gave similar results we only show the results of MySQL  database for illustration purposes Table I shows the time in seconds to perform aggregation by GROUP BY with ROLLUP operator using the following SQL statement SELECT C.area M.store P.category M.product SUM M.sales AS s_sum FROM M P C WHERE M.product=P.product AND M.store=C.store GROUP BY C.area M.store P.category M.product WITH ROLLUP Listing 1 Aggregation is accomplished by SQL ROLLUP operator Relational databases spend a considerable amount of time for large data writes such as INSERT or UPDATE  which are needed by both distribution and exception detection Table II shows the time in seconds to perform UPDATE for MySQL Apparently when the data size is large such as 100 million it is dif  cult for a relational database to meet the realtime requirement for a collaborative planning application This leads us to move away from relational databases and develop BigOject a general-purpose computing system as the foundation of our collaborative planning application III B IG O BJECT BigObject is an in-place computing system for multidimensional data Data are organized in big objects which 


 Figure 5 Architecture of BigObject are in place in 64-bit memory space and in place to execute an expression or an algorithm Similar to macromolecules in living cells big objects are also well organized that all necessary data and data structures are self-contained having no need to allocate memory from the heap space This is an important requirement to guarantee scalability for data size growing beyond the swap space size of the running machine In order to implement an ef  cient in-place computing model BigObject supports three critical mechanisms 1 inmemory mechanism 2 trans formation mechanism and 3 data-centric computing mechanism This  rst describes how big objects reside in 64-bit memory space persistently The second describes how to create or transform big objects from raw data or other big objects And the third describes a programming framework to run code directly on big objects Similar to Unix/C architecture the architecture of BigObject consists of three layers BigObject base  kernel and programming framework  as shown in Fig 5 BigObject base is a persistent data space as well as a computing space in which big objects are born live and work Like Unix kernel BigObject kernel provides a set of functions to create and manipulate big objects The top layer of the architecture is a programming framework which supports language constructs and API for developers to write code with big objects BigObject base can be treated as an in-memory database if a query language is provided Like most NoSQL systems   i t i s pos s i bl e t o i mpl e ment S Q L f or B i gO bj ect  H o w e v er  our intention is to stay away from the computing approach that relies heavily on data retrieval during computation The programming framework is not designed for query purposes but used to program real algorithms for the computing purpose Ef  ciency i.e performance an d expressiveness i.e highlevel way to manipulate big data are two key design principles for BigObject A Big Objects BigObject organizes data in multi-dimensional space A dimension is composed of a set of members each of which has certain properties called attributes  For example age and gender are common attributes in customer dimension Data to be analyzed such as actual sales or forecasted sales are called measures  Multi-dimensional data are naturally de  ned in relational databases with star schema For example Table III and IV de  ne two dimensions channel and product andtheir attributes area and category  Table V is a measure table of sales records each row indicating the sales amount for a product sold at a store TABLE III A CHANNEL DIMENSION TABLE channel.store channel.area S1 NY S2 NY S3 CA TABLE IV A PRODUCT DIMENSION TABLE product.sku product.category P1 Food P2 Food P3 Cloth TABLE V A SALES MEASURE TABLE channel.store product.sku sales value S1 P1 6 S1 P2 5 S1 P3 7 S2 P3 8 S3 P1 4 S3 P2 9  CA S3 Food P2 P1 NY S2 Cloth P3 S1 Cloth P3 Food P2 P1 channel.area channel.store product.category product.sku S1,P1  S1,P2 S1,P3 S2,P3 S3,P1 S3,P2 Figure 6 A tree object actual-sales with hierarchy channel.area  channel.store  product.category  product.sku  Both dimensions and measures are organized into table objects with a structure similar to table in relational databases In our example sales object is a table object Another kind of object in BigObject is tree object A tree object has a hierarchical st ructure that is suitable for performing analytical computation ef  ciently Fig 6 shows a tree object derived from sales object where hierarchical attributes from top to bottom are channel.area  channel.store  product.category  product.sku Weuse a 1  a 2 to denote that the level of attribute a 1 is higher than the level of a 2 in the tree hierarchy For example the root of sales object has two child nodes holding data NY and CA as shown in Fig 6 The data structures of the table objects and tree objects look like any normal data structures we often see in C/C or Java However they are implemented to hold the following properties  Big  capable of maintaining a large size of data elements addressable in one big space e.g 64-bit address space  In-place  ready to compute no query no explicit data retrieval  Persistent  viable to keep the state which outlives the process that created it  Relocatable  movable from one space to another in same machine or different machines 


   Figure 7 Memory-mapped big objects B In-Memory Mechanism Big objects are implemented using the memory mapping technique Memory mapping that implements demand paging became available for application developers in POSIXcompliant Unix since the 1980s This allows programs to allocate virtual memory space backed by a memory-mapped  le As shown in Fig 7 a memory-mapped  le is a segment of virtual memory assigned a direct mapping with a  le a block device or any resource that can be opened for random access The adoption of memory-mapped  les resolves the performance problems such as data movement juggling and swapping that we discussed in the previous section As a storage unit the memory space used in a big object is automatically mapped and saved in the memory-mapped  le As a computing unit algorithms can be directly applied on the memory structure of a big object transparently without any explicit data retrieval and additional memory allocation The beauty of the memory-mapping approach is that a big object is simply a  le in which the content of the object can be preserved even if the system is powered off or move around in different machines It can also serve as a paging device when the big object is computing In other words memory-mapped big objects meet the desired four properties big in-place persistent and re locatable More importantly the size of a memory-mapped  le can be bigger than the size of the swap space which supports a scalable solution to hold and manipulate data in 64-bit address space or whatever the address space limitation of OS 42-bit or 48-bit for Linux C Transformation Mechanism Transformation is a common technique used in science which converts a problem into some form easy to manipulate The mapper in MapReduce is an example of transformation which transforms a key-value domain into another However transformation doesn’t come free It always incurs cost more or less depending on the underlying implementation The idea of transformation mechanism is to transform data into a data structure suitable for ef  cient computation assuming the cost of transformation can be tolerated BigObject adopts a transformation mechanism Transformative Join  Trans-Join in short by using a similar semantics of join from relational algabra  T rans join t rans forms a big object into a tree object according to a desired hierarchy 39 CA:13 S3:13 Food:13 P2:9 P1:4  NY:26 S2:8 Cloth:8 P3:8 S1:18 Cloth:7 P3:7 Food:11 P2:5 P1:6 S1,P1  S1,P2 S1,P3 S2,P3 S3,P1 S3,P2  aggregate   parent+=current   program tag ping ping Figure 8 Aggregation using a program tag It is a binary operator which takes a big object as the  rst operand and an attribute of a dimension as the second operand and creates a tree object A trans-join operation lifts the hierarchy of the tree object one level up by grouping the leaf nodes by the attribute For each group of leaf nodes that share the same attribute value an intermediate node is created as the new parent node of the group As a result a new level of intermediate nodes are inserted between the leaf nodes and the original parent nodes For example the tree object actual-sales in Fig 6 is transjoined from the sales measure table object in Table V based on hierarchy channel.area  channel.store  product.category  product.sku  This process is similar to using GROUP BY with ROLLUP operator on columns channel.area  channel.store  product.category and product.sku by joining sales measure  channel and product tables in SQL Trans-join operator differs from the JOIN/GROUP BY/ROLLLUP operators in that it physically constructs an object with tree structure rather than outputs a table in relational model  S i n ce t r ans j o i n can be us ed t o cons t r uct a t r ee object with the desired level of hierarchy which allows us to create the most suitable tree object for ef  cient computing tasks In our collaborative planni ng application each different hierarchical view i.e tree object can be easily constructed by using trans-join The data is shared among all tree objects at the leaf level and the aggregated values in intermediate nodes are computed and analyzed accordingly D Data Centric Computing Mechanism One of the key ingredients of in-place computing is data centric computing in which computations take place where the data resides Instead of using query languages such as SQL to retrieve necessary data out of databases BigObject adopts a simple programming framework which allows 1 a piece of program to attach to a tree object node for execution and 2 expressing and evaluating an arithmetic expression of big objects This framework together with compiler optimization not only provides a high-level expressive power but also delivers good performance The  rst feature in the programming framework is realized by a language construct called Program Tag s  and the second feature is done by Macro Expression  Program Tag

   Figure 12 Spectrum for computing models on commodity machines The performance of applications using the traditional computing model suffers from large volume of data retrieval and update By using in-place computing technology the experiment results show that a collaborative planning application can be built to handle big data with acceptable response time using a commodity machine The question left for the readers is whether to trade the traditional approach based on relational databases for such performance gain V C ONCLUSION A real-world collaborative planning application is complex The complexity depends on the number of concurrent participants in the collaboration as well as the data characteristics volume and valence which det ermine the performance of the application The traditional computing model based on databases is inadequate for processing big data with high valence Meanwhile most commonly adopted approaches for big data computing such as Hadoop w e re not des i gned speci  cally for real-time computing and may suffer from performance problems due to large data shuf  ing among multiple servers Instead we take an unconventional approach in-place computing model to address the issues raised by big volume and high valence BigObject is an in-place computing system designed for storing and computing multi-dimensional data It focuses on squeezing i.e scaling in computing performance out of the CPU’s of a single machine by trading space complexity with time complexity The general availability of 64-bit architecture makes this possible and triggers revisits to many software areas to rethink alternatives for potential performance leap By building a collaborative planning application based on BigObject we are able to study the behavior of the in-place computing system and evaluate its performance against the traditional approach In the application BigObject demonstrates with signi  cant performance gain and well-organized complexity in both data structure and behavior Our experiment shows that the application takes seconds to compute one hundred millions of data records using one core one CPU and one machine In-place co mputing approach outperforms the approach based on traditional computing model in two orders of magnitude As part of the result from the experiment we have learned the comfort zone for in-place computing Fig 12 shows a spectrum of computing power and the corresponding computing models on today’s commodity machines In-place computing model is capable of delivering computing power between million operations per second mega-operations and billion operations per second giga-operations It is feasible and practical to process data up to one billion of records or low terabytes of raw data within a reasonable timeframe using one commodity machine with multiple cores and multiple CPU’s When processing data more than billions of records it will require a distributed approach In-place computing offers an affordable solution for processing data with high valence and volume up to one billion of records R EFERENCES 1 J  D ean and S  G hem a w a t M apr e duce s i m p li  ed data processing on large

order in which they occurred As in the previous benchmark the data”ow graph of the weather explorer script consisted of a single MapReduce job WeatherMR for both Rout and PigLatin But in our script we used the operator to join temperature and wind speed inputs instead of the operator Because of this for Rout the scripts could be executed while keeping data GD the distribution of the input data based on the year of its recording allowed to be applied For the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within of the time of the corresponding PigLatin script VI R ELATED W ORK This section describes work related to Rout and Rrun Apache Cascading is another open-source data”o w engine Cascading consists of a data processing API integration API process planer and process scheduler Like Pig Cascading operates on top of Hadoop in a single datacenter FlumeJava is a statically typed data processing language proposed by Google It is implemented as a Java library A data”ow graph making use of MapReduce jobs for parallelization is generated from a FlumeJava program PQL is another extension of Java recently proposed by Reichenbach et al PQL is a logic-based declarati v e language which facilitates the expression of parallel elements of a computing task with regular Java code being used to deal with the sequential portions The approach supports programmer productivity and allows for aggressive optimizations PQL does not address geo-\ution PLINQ is an e xtension of LINQ 23 for parallel querying of data similar to PQL PLINQ enjoys explicit syntactic support inside NET In contrast to PQL PLINQ is inspired by SQL-style relational queries select statements and is not fully declarative DryadLINQ is an implementation of LINQ for the e x ecution engine None of these languages or their runtime environments currently support setups beyond a single datacenter/cluster Given that all the above-mentioned languages and models revolve around data structures and collections e.g sets maps along with arrays in PQL they are amenable to augmentation with GD data structures Many efforts focus on optimizing data”ow execution instead of dealing with geo-\ution This includes countless optimizations for the MapReduce framework targeting single clusters These are complementary to our work Parcae is a no v el parallel e x ecution en vironment optimized for multiexecutions The solution includes a compiler that creates exible parallel programs a monitor which determines and analyzes resource availability and system performance and an executor which may replace the executing tasks with ones that are better suited for the operating environment Airavat aims at secure analysis of third-party datasets with MapReduce providing strong privacy guarantees in the face of untrusted tasks When combined with a secure inter-datacenter data transfer mechanism solutions such as Airavat can be seamlessly integrated to Rrun to improve the security guarantees of the distributed execution Most commercial databases such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server are designed to handle highly structured data that is available in a single location Many of these databases support multi-region deployments but for high availability and/or fault tolerance Thus they are unsuited for handling GD data Amazon RDS is a cloud-based database solution The back-end of RDS is a relational database deployed in Amazon datacenters RDS supports multi\(availability zone deployments But this is not truly GD since Amazon availability zones are located within a single datacenter Volley is a system for automatically geo-distrib uting data based on the needs of an application presupposing knowledge on the placement of its data client access patterns and locations Based on this information data will be dynamically migrated between datacenters to optimize access times Services like

feature named allows Walter to provide strong guarantees while performing replication asynchronously In Walter nodes within a datacenter observe transactions on a consistent snapshot with global ordering while nodes across sites only have to follow causal ordering COPS is another k e y-v alue storage system for GD data COPS is highly scalable and can enforce causal dependencies The main strategy of COPS consists in enforcing causal dependencies between keys before writes are exposed VII C ONCLUSIONS The cloud computing paradigm provides a partial response to data challenges Clouds are however implemented by concrete datacenters whose geographical location matter and no single datacenter can host all the data in the world reliably and ef“ciently The current toolchain has to mature by considering real-life constraints such as geographical distribution or administrative domains This paper has presented Rout a data processing language capable of expressing programs involving datasets from multiple datacenters including individual datasets that are partitioned across datacenters As illustrated by our empirical evaluation even on GD data processing programs compiled to few MapReduce stages Rout is able to reduce the execution time down to half compared to a straightforward schedule which consolidates all data rst At the same time Rout exposes only little geo-distribution to programmers We are currently exploring further copy heuristics and datacenter selection policies than those presented in Section IV the integration of access control for multi-domain setups and the integration our GD model with other data”ow languages R EFERENCES  Y  Y u M Isard D Fetterly  M Budiu U Erlingsson P  K Gunda and J Currey DryadLINQ A System for Generalpurpose Distributed Data-parallel Computing Using a Highlevel Language in
