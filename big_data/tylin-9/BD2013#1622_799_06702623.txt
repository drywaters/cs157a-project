datasets Recent studies have started to utilize indexing subsetting and data reorganization to manage the increasingly large datasets In this work we present an approach to boost the data analysis performance namely Fast Analysis with Statistical Metadata FASM via data subsetting and integrating a small amount of statistics into the original datasets The added statistical information illustrates the data shape and provides knowledge of the data distribution therefore the original I/O libraries can utilize these statistical metadata to perform fast queries and analyses Various subsetting schemes can affect the access pattern and the I/O performance We present a comparison study of different subsetting schemes by focusing on three dominant factors the shape the concurrency and the locality The added 
statistical metadata slightly increases the original data size and we evaluate the cost and trade-off as well This work is the rst study that utilizes statistical metadata with various subsetting schemes to perform fast queries and analyses on large datasets The proposed FASM approach is currently evaluated with the PnetCDF on Lustre le systems but can also be implemented with other scienti“c libraries The FASM can potentially lead to a new dataset design and can have an impact on big data analysis Keywords  high performance computing data-intensive computing big data storage systems statistical techniques FASM I I NTRODUCTION The volume of data collected from instruments and gener 
ated from simulations for scienti“c discovery and innovation keeps increasing rapidly For example the Global Cloud Resolving Model GCRM project part of DOE s Scienti“c Discovery through Advanced Computing SciDAC program is built on a geodesic grid that consists of more than 100 million hexagonal columns with 128 levels per column These 128 levels will cover a layer of 50 kilometers of atmosphere up from the surface of the earth For each of these grid cells scientists need to store analyze and predict parameters like the wind speed temperature pressure etc Most of these global atmospheric models process data in a 100-kilometer scale the distance on the ground however scientists desire higher resolution and ner granularity which can lead to 
signi“cantly larger sizes of datasets Another example is the data requirements of representative scienti“c applications run at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility ALCF through the DOEs INCITE program The data v olume processed online by many of these applications has exceeded TBs or even tens of TBs the off-line data is near PBs of scale How to ef“ciently analyze and retrieve the datasets has become a key challenge in processing the rapidly growing volume of data Scienti“c datasets and libraries including HDF5 NetCDF 6 PnetCDF 8 and ADIOS[1 ha v e been well developed and widely used in recent years for scienti“c data management With these libraries datasets are stored in a speci“c format Scienti“c applications can make use of these 
libraries high performance I/O to accelerate the processing performance Those libraries however are still not ef“cient enough for scientists e.g they lack non-procedural query and suf“cient indexing Thus researchers have begun employing existing useful techniques of traditional databases into scienti“c datasets For example FastBit is a powerful tool that implements indexing in datasets Users can use F astBit to build compressed bitmap indices over the datasets based on demand and the performance can be improved dramatically In this study we argue that the raw datasets and current formats are not suf“cient for achieving the best performance  Signi“cant performance improvements can be achieved with 
redesigning the datasets and enhancing relevant libraries Our main idea is to perform data subsetting on raw datasets and then add a small amount of statistical metadata into raw datasets to guide data accesses Even though the idea of utilizing statistics in scienti“c datasets has been mentioned in 13 none of their w ork presents a systematic study and detailed analyses on integrating statistics into scienti“c datasets In this paper we present our investigation results and a system named Fast Analysis with Statistical Metadata FASM The contribution of this research is three-fold First we propose an idea of subsetting and adding statistical metadata into scienti“c datasets to facilitate data analysis and query processing Second we have designed and prototyped a FASM 
system to evaluate the idea Third we have carried out extensive experimental tests to verify the potential of FASM and the results have con“rmed that the FASM approach signi“cantly improves the data analysis performance It can have an impact on scienti“c dataset design developing scienti“c data libraries and storage systems and addressing big data challenges An initial nding was presented in and this paper presents a complete study of the FASM system 978-1-4799-0898-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 


The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II discusses the background and the motivation of this work Section III introduces the design of the FASM system Section IV presents the evaluation results and analysis with both synthetic and real datasets Section V discusses related work and compares with this study We summarize this study and discuss future work in Section VI II BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATIONS Scientists are interested in understanding the phenomenon behind the data The data in many data-intensive scienti“c applications are often written once and read many times which is known as WORM access pattern F o r instance astrophysics scientists try to understand cosmology behavior by analyzing data collected from large telescopes many times Many other scienti“c applications share a similar discovery pattern such as climate modeling high-energy physics medicine discovery etc These applications collect data from instruments and the datasets grow from many consecutive collections These datasets will be read and analyzed many times later on in an attempt to understand the phenomenon A typical data analysis conducted by atmosphere scientists for climate modeling study is shown in Figure 1 Scientists often need to perform such queries to select data points of interests for understanding the phenomenon behind the data Select data points From datasets Where pressure>80 And 12<temperature<25 Fig 1 Sample Query Request Traditionally without any prior knowledge of the datasets one would need to look at all the data points and compare the values of pressure and temperature within a speci“ed range to carry out this data analysis e.g 12<temperature<25 which is a costly process Instead we could potentially utilize the prior knowledge of the underlying datasets such as the data structure distribution variable ranges and other statistical information to facilitate such data analysis For instance the pressure of the atmosphere is normally less than 70 kPa for 4,000 meters above the sea level If we could analyze the distribution and integrate a small amount of statistical information such as the minimum and maximum value into each subset we could potentially improve the data analysis performance For this speci“c example if the maximum pressure within a subset is less than 80 kPa then there is no need to look into the data points in such subset and therefore the data analysis performance can be signi“cantly improved Figure 2 plots an initial performance comparison This test was carried out using two groups of datasets with various dataset sizes One group was integrated with statistical metadata we term as metadata rich datasets another was the original dataset The input of the program was a range query request as described in Figure 1 We performed 30 tests and calculated the average We can observe a clear performance improvement from the result The data analysis response time was reduced signi“cantly using the integrated statistical metadata by up to 4 folds Such statistical metadata however is not supported in existing data management libraries and programming interfaces This study presents a systematic design of integrating such statistical metadata into scienti“c datasets and enhancing I/O libraries to facilitate data analysis The idea presented in this research is similar to indexing schemes widely used to boost data access however not like an indexing scheme statistical metadata will not increase the original dataset size as much as an indexing scheme does A typical indexing scheme can double the size of original datasets and can be a concern for big data applications with huge storage requirements We argue that the proposed lightweight approach with small amount of additional metadata can improve the data processing performance without increasing the storage overhead dramatically which is con“rmed by the experimental results as well           382M 763M 1.5G Response Time\(s Metadata Rich Datasets Original Datasets Fig 2 Performance Improvement with Integrated Statistical Metadata III F AST A NALYSIS WITH S TATISTICAL M ETADATA In this section we introduce the design of the proposed Fast Analysis with Statistical Metadata FASM system and discuss each component A System Architecture 012 015\015 015	\012\015  015  015	\015\015   015\015    015	\012\015 Fig 3 System Architecture As shown in Figure 3 the FASM system has four major components Subsetting Statistics Generating Metadata Rich 


Datasets and FASM Runtime When the datasets are stored in the le system at the rst time two components subsetting and statistics-generating will process the data rst The subsetting component will partition the datasets into subsets The statistics-generating component will calculate the statistics of each subset and store them together with the raw data as the Metadata Rich Datasets The enhanced datasets will be used in subsequent analyses and the data access and analysis will be guided by the integrated statistics These steps are supported by the enhanced I/O library and optimized access codes B Subsetting Given a query e.g Figure 1 there exists different optimizations to ef“ciently answer it and achieve less I/O cost in the data retrieval The various subsetting schemes in FASM is designed to optimize the I/O In real applications the query usually targets a small subset A carefully designed subsetting scheme can quickly locate the targeting subsets and reduce the I/O For example query happens on 2D planes at different altitude will perfer a pre-de“ned subsetting on 2D planes than 3D cubes Different ways of subsetting exist and can provide users various views of the datasets The query and data analysis performance in terms of response time and latency could be varied We de“ne and study three subsetting schemes in this research In current development the FASM system maintains and supports different schemes at the runtime 1 Dimension-Driven Subsetting The rst subsetting scheme dimension-driven subsetting scheme is shown in Figure 4 with a sample 3-D dataset The scheme applies to other multiple dimensional datasets as well The sub“gure a illustrates a subsetting scheme with ne granularity Each subset is extracted from only one dimension each time The sub“gure b shows a subsetting by partitioning the datasets into 2-D planes either along the slowest dimension in a real climate application the slowest dimension is usually the time dimension or along the fastest dimension The sub“gure c illustrates a 3-D subset scheme The last sub“gure d demonstrates a combination of the aforementioned subsetting schemes A combination-subsetting scheme can potentially provide the user with rich statistical knowledge of the entire dataset This is because that for instance in a global temperature dataset the temperature value usually has different range and distribution in different seasons and different areas Simple subsetting along one or two dimension can not reveal the data characteristics well The input of a dimension-driven subsetting algorithm includes the original dataset and prede“ned subsetting scheme The return includes the position and size of each subset For 1-D 2-D and 3-D subsetting schemes the position and size of each subset are directly calculated and returned e.g subset_2D_i\(time:1:2,level:2:3,lat:0:10,lon:0:10 in which time:1:2 means subsetting from the second time step to the third time step one time step totally For the combination-subsetting scheme the prede“ned subsets are extracted according to their scheme and size information For instance in sub“gure d of Figure 4 there are three basic schemes 1-D 2-D and 3-D The subsetting scheme is recursively de“ned and performed till the entire dataset is partitioned When all subsetting steps are done the position and size of each subset are returned The statistics-generating component in the FASM system utilizes this information to compute the needed statistical metadata  d a c b Fig 4 Dimension-driven Subsetting 2 Locality-Driven Subsetting It is often desired to prune the search space with integrated statistics while accessing as much contiguous data as possible at the same t 0 t n-1  t 1  time  lon lat level Fig 5 Locality-driven Subsetting We motivate the second subsetting scheme with the consideration of locality We discuss how subsetting affects the locality and vice versa using the same temperature model as an example The datasets four dimensions ranked from the slowest to the fastest are time level latitude and longitude For every two dimensions 2-D plane of the 4-D datasets we can calculate the statistics of all the points within the plane Different subsetting schemes however can lead to various localities in accessing datasets For instance as shown in Figure 5 when the subsetting scheme is along the lon level 2-D plane then accessing a 2-D plane in these two dimensions will generate many non-contiguous I/Os The elements on lon level:0 and lon level:1 are logically contiguous however the physical distance between them is lon   lat  1  The same situation happens in subsetting lat level plane When it comes to lat time plane the locality tends to be worse as the physical distance between lat 0 and lat 1 is  level  lon  1  lat  which is the size of a single 3-D subset Similar results can be found in level time subsetting Table I summarizes subsetting schemes and impact on locality the distance between contiguous subsets The FASM considers the applications read pattern to direct the subsetting scheme choice in consideration of data locality

D FASM Runtime The FASM Runtime component leverages integrated statistical metadata to facilitate data analysis and queries In PnetCDF library the ncmpi_get_vara_type function can read an array of various types from a PnetCDF dataset same with NetCDF dataset The access pattern is de“ned by giving starting position and a vector of edge lengths For example in the function int ncmpi_get_vara_”oat int ncid int varid const size_t start const size_t count  oat fp  access pattern is speci“ed by starting position array start and length array count The FASM approach essentially optimizes these accesses at runtime by guiding the data range to be analyzed given subsetting and generated statistics Without the support from the FASM each access will start from the beginning position and run until the very end meaning every data point is accessed This process is costly and the results include many useless subsets With FASM after ltering the useless subsets a vector storing the target position information is passed to the original read function Thus the read function gets a modi“ed access pattern in which each access has a modi“ed starting position and reduced length for the target subset IV EVALUATION A Experimental Platform We have conducted experimental tests on a 640-node cluster Each node within the cluster contains two Intel Xeon Westmere 2.8 GHz 6-core processors with 24 GB of memory The nodes are connected with DDR In“niband Overall the cluster has a peak rating of 86 tera”ops and a High Performance Linpack HPL score of 68 tera”ops We evaluated the FASM system with a group of datasets which include both synthetic and real application datasets For each dataset we have varied subsetting schemes and statistics selected to verify the potential and study their impacts The query response time and the overhead were analyzed B Data Analysis and Queries Evaluated We have generated a group of synthetic datasets The le size was ranged from 300 KB to 100 GB Each le was generated separately with different data values The synthetic datasets were generated with the consideration of real application needs For instance the datasets usually spread across a multi-level grid Therefore in each box we rst generated a random value x and the remaining data within the box were generated close to the x e.g x  20  With this way we can avoid a global normal distribution and match the synthetic datasets with the real datasets We have also tested the FASM approach using a real dataset the BCCR-BCM 2.0 model This is a climate model dataset downloaded from Bjerknes Center for Climate Research The size of the dataset ranges from 100MB to 1.8GB and the total size of these datasets is more than 12 GB The data analysis and query statements were also generated randomly We evaluated the FASM system using 20 different query statements Different queries requested different volumes of data The generated query statements had a normal distribution of those cases            39M 382M 763M 1.5G Response Time \(s Min_Max Min Max Original Fig 8 Evaluations with Different Statistics C Performance Comparison of Statistics The statistical metadata extracted in evaluations included the minimum and maximum values In this subsection we compare those different statistical metadata and their related performance As reported in Figure 8 the FASM approach with integrated statistics did not improve the performance obviously when the dataset size was small As the dataset size increased the FASM approach demonstrated clear performance advantages We have also shown different statistical metadata and their impacts These two statistics min and max have a slight difference in query and analysis ef“ciency but the difference is clearly dependent on the data distribution and data analysis requests D Overhead Analysis The integrated additional statistical metadata can cause storage overhead We have measured the size of additional metadata for each subsetting scheme for a 4-D dataset and the result is shown in Figure 9 The conclusion is that the storage overhead is less than one percent for three subsetting schemes The overhead is near nine percent for only one subsetting scheme Overall the FASM system can utilize this small amount of metadata to improve the performance without dramatically increasing the storage overhead whereas the storage overhead is normally a concern for other techniques like indexing       012         015                        012       overhead Fig 9 Storage Overhead The added metadata can also lead to a concern of computation cost However such cost only occurs once when data

 lat  lon  and the number of layers levels accessed at one time can be changed We then have varied the number of steps and test the subsetting scheme 1 Figure 13 reports the results conducted on 40 storage nodes where the strip size was set to 5MBs The dataset is 382MBs 4-D temperature data As access steps were changed the concurrency was changed too with different response times The best performance was 5.2 times faster than the slowest We can also nd that the response time begun increasing when the access step was larger than 50 This is due to the I/O latency outweighing the concurrency gain These tests con“rmed that the concurrency plays a role in the overall system performance The FASM system decides which subsetting scheme is better based on the data distribution and applications read pattern                            Response Time\(s Fig 13 Concurrency with Various Access Steps G Scalability Analysis We have carried out tests to verify the scalability of subsetting schemes in the FASM system as well The results are reported in Figure 14 Y-aixs is the speedup Previous evaluations show that certain subsetting schemes e.g sub 1 perform better than others in terms of locality however they tend to not scale well We plot sub4 in Figure 14 to show that even one subsetting is worse in locality but it could be better in scalability Through such comparison and previous analysis we can see there is no best scheme for all cases The performance is partially determined by how the applications access the data Therefore we keep all schemes at the same time in current FASM system each scheme has minor additional statistical metadata thus does not increase the storage overhead considerably The system utilizes all schemes to optimize the access We have also tested the scalability with respect to the access steps and Figure 15 shows the results Y-axis is speedup Sub1-1 refers to the subsetting scheme 1 with only one access step Sub1-500 refers to the subsetting scheme 1 with accessing 500 levels each time Sub1-500 tends to be more scalable due to the larger data chunks while sub1-1 issues many non-contiguous small I/Os This shows that the number of steps can have an effect on the performance the FASM makes sure that the number of steps is not too small to cause scalability issue H Real Application Test We have performed tests with real application datasets from the BCCR model as well Six NetCDF datasets were evaluated 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 16 32 64 Number of Cores sub1-1 sub2 sub3 sub4 Fig 14 Scalability Analysis of Different Schemes                         Number of Cores sub1-1 sub1-500 Fig 15 Scalability Analysis of One Scheme with Different Access Steps Each dataset contains three dimensions time latitude and longitude The latitude dimension has 64 or 128 different values The longitude dimension has 128 or 256 different values The time dimension is unlimited Figure 16 shows the performance improvement It can be observed that the FASM approach clearly reduced the response time in all cases Taking the 1.8GB dataset as an example the analysis cost was reduced from 5.5 to 3 seconds The FASM approach was able to achieve up to 3.5 times speedup across all tests 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 115M 225M 290M 450M 1.2G 1.8G Response Time \(ms FASM Original Datasets Fig 16 BCCR Model Test Using FASM V R ELATED W ORK In 12 16 the authors introduced an o v ervie w o f the trend of future data management The authors concluded 


a common set of requirements for a new science database system which is named SciDB In recent years techniques in traditional databases have been integrated into scienti“c datasets The inde xing scheme is a representati v e e xample In 10 the authors de v eloped the F astBit system to pro vide a set of compressed bitmap indexes Various research efforts have been carried out to optimize queries over the scienti“c dataset In the authors designed tools to support user de“ned subsetting and aggregation over NetCDF datasets In their system the query results are aggregated on the server side before returning to the process which reduces the data transfer cost In this research we propose and study a fast data analysis approach with integrated statistical metadata The proposed approach has a similar idea to the indexing scheme but is lightweight and incurs signi“cantly less storage overhead when compared to the indexing schemes In addition the FASM approach complements existing database techniques that are already adopted for scienti“c datasets An even better performance is expected when they are combined together The ADIOS also demonstrates that integrating the statistical metadata could potentially improve the performance 1 Ho we v e r  the current ADIOS only supports collecting local simple statistical and/or analytical data during the output operation for use in identifying desired datasets The FASM system provides the mechanism of integrating the statistical metadata during the initial write In addition this metadata can be further utilized This research has studied various subsetting schemes and the impact on performance as well Parallel netCDF PnetCDF is a library that provides highperformance I/O while maintaining le-format compatibility with Unidatas NetCDF Our F ASM system is prototyped based on PnetCDF currently All these work have shown the importance of scienti“c datasets and data management libraries In this study we propose an approach to subsetting dataset and integrating with statistics Our study complements these existing datasets and libraries and can be helpful to many data-intensive applications VI CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Scienti“c datasets are used in many data-intensive computing elds such as climate modeling high-energy physics astrophysics computational chemistry computational biology medicine discovery etc Research efforts have started integrating modern database techniques and parallel I/O into the management of scienti“c datasets In this work we proposed a new idea of adding statistical metadata into the datasets The statistical metadata illustrates the data distribution features therefore the parallel access code can utilize this metadata to perform fast queries and data analysis Through experimental tests and evaluations we have shown how the integrated statistical metadata improves the query and analysis performance We have also analyzed the impact of various subsetting schemes statistics generating scalability and overhead The evaluation results have indicated that the FASM approach is promising and can be bene“cial to many data-intensive scienti“c applications In the near future we will investigate further to support data modi“cations resubsetting and regeneration of statistics in the FASM at runtime We will study the feasibility of automatic selection of statistics

In addition we also explicitly computed the max-min fair ow bandwidths for these traf“c pro“les using the water-“lling algorithm W e compared the resulting aggre gate throughput to those reported by the simulator For all evaluated traf“c patterns the simulator throughput was within 10 of those reported by the maxmin validator This small difference is because the TCPs AIMD congestion control mechanism only yields approximate max-min fairness in ow bandwidths whereas the validator computes a perfectly max-min fair distribution 6.2 HyperX Networks We rst evaluate Dahu with HyperX networks which have many paths of differing lengths between any source and destination We simulate a  L 3 S 14 T 48 HyperX network with 1Gbps links as described in This models a lar ge data center with 131,712 servers interconnected by 2,744 switches and an oversubscription ratio of 1:8 We seek to measure how Dahus non-minimal routing and load balancing affect performance as we vary traf“c patterns the maximum derouting threshold and non-minimal routing scheme constrained or not We run simulations with Clique and Mixed traf“c patterns described next and compare the throughput average hop count and link utilizations for Dahu and ECMP In the graphs Dahun refers to Dahu routing with at most n deroutings C-Dahun refers to the similar Constrained Dahu routing variant 6.2.1 Clique Traf“c Pattern A Clique is a subset of switches and associated hosts that communicate among themselves each host communicates with every other host in its clique over time This represents distributed jobs in a data center which are usually run on a subset of the server pool A typical job runs on a few racks of servers There could be multiple cliques or jobs running in different parts of the network We parameterize this traf“c pattern by i clique size the number of switches in the clique and ii total number of cliques in the network In this experiment we vary the total number of cliques from 64 to 768 keeping the clique size xed at 2 switches 96 servers Each source switch in a clique generates 18Gbps of traf“c with 1.5 MB average ow size  Figure 8 Throughput gain with Clique traf“c pattern Bandwidth Figure 8 shows the bandwidth gains with Dahu relative to ECMP as we vary the number of communicating cliques Dahu offers substantial gains of 400-500 over ECMP The performance gain is highest with a smaller number of cliques showing that indeed derouting and non-shortest path forwarding can effectively take advantage of excess bandwidth in HyperX networks a Average hop count         b Link utilization number of cliques  512 Figure 9 Average hop count and link utilization for Clique traf“c pattern with different routing schemes This validates a major goal of this work which is improving the statistical multiplexing of bandwidth in direct network topologies As the number of cliques increases the bandwidth slack in the network decreases and the relative bene“t of non-minimal routing comes down to around 250 Dahu and constrained Dahu have similar performance for the same derouting threshold We further nd that a large derouting threshold provides larger bene“t with less load since there are many unused links in the network As load increases links are more utilized on average bandwidth slack reduces and a derouting threshold of one starts performing better Hop count Beyond raw throughput latency in an important performance metric that is related to network hop count Figure 9a shows the average hop count for each routing scheme Dahu delivers signi“cantly higher bandwidth with a small increase in average hop count Average hop count increases with increase in derouting threshold For smaller derouting threshold the hop count is similar to that of ECMP while still achieving most of the bandwidth improvements of non-minimal routing Note that the small error bars indicate that the average hop count is similar while varying the number of cliques Link utilization Figure 9b shows the CDF of inter-switch link utilizations for ECMP and Dahu for the experiment with 512 cliques With shortest path routing 90 of the links have zero utilization whereas Dahu achieves its bandwidth gains by utilizing available capacity on additional links in the network Also we see that a single derouting can achieve most of the overall bandwidth gains while consuming bandwidth on signi“cantly fewer links in the network thereby sparing network capacity for more traf“c 67

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 sub”ows and can also handle short ows with ef“cient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer sub”ows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large bene“ts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have suf“cient traf“c and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple re“nement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modi“ed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satis“ed 1 It doesnt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satis“ed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted traf“c through this path for the particular destination pre“x for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butter”y 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jelly“sh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance traf“c Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jelly“sh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple sub”ows and modulating how much data is sent over different sub”ows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by sub”ows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to ef“ciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet traf“c splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Traf“c engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic traf“c changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related traf“c engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy traf“c demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insuf“cient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of traf“c onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modi“cations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different traf“c patterns and show that it signi“cantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing sub”ows 69
