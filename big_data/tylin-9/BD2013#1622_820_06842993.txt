216   BUDGET CONSTRAINED PRIORITY BASED GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR WORKFLOW SCHEDULING IN CLOUD Amandeep Verma 1 and Sakshi Kaushal 1  1 University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India amandeepverma@pu.ac.in, sakshi@pu.ac.in   Abstract Data transfer is a big overhead for cloud workflows due to pay-as-use business model of cloud environment. In such environment, the cost arising from data transfers between resources as well as execution costs must also be taken into account during scheduling 
based upon user’s Quality of Service \(QoS\constraints In this paper, we present Priority based Genetic Algorithm BCHGA to schedule workflow applications to cloud resources that optimize the total cost of workflow within the user’s specified budget. Each workflow’s task is assigned priority using bottom level b-level\ and top level \(t-level\. To increase the population diversity, these priorities are then used to create the initial population of BCHGA. The proposed algorithm is simulated in java and evaluated with synthetic workflows based on realistic workflows from the different areas by considering the pricing model of cloud service provider like Amazon. The simulation 
results show that our proposed algorithm has a promising performance as compared to Standard Genetic Algorithm \(SGA   Keywords Cloud Computing, Workflow, Scheduling DAG, Genetic Algorithm, b-level, t-level  INTRODUCTION Cloud computing delivers hardware infrastructure and software applications as services on demand over Internet through virtualization [1  It a d opt s a m a rk e t oriented business model where users are charged for consuming cloud services such as computing, storage and network services like conventional utilities in everyday life \(e.g. water, electricity, gas, and telephony  a p a y a s you-go b a s i s    
Workflow scheduling is one of the key challenging issues in the cloud workflow systems. It allocates suitable resources to workflow tasks such that the execution can be completed to satisfy objective functions imposed by users   There are two major types of scheduling for grid workflows: best-effort based and QoS constraint based scheduling  T h e s e s c he du l i n g a l gori t h m s  a t t e m p t t o  minimise the execution time, ignoring other factors such as the monetary cost of accessing resources. But, as Cloud computing adopts “market-oriented business model”, so there is another important parameter other than the execution time i.e 
cost of accessing resources 6  U s u al ly f a s t er r e s o u r ces a r e mo r e ex p e n s iv e th an  the slower one. Therefore, scheduling algorithms applicable in grid workflow scheduling cannot be directly applied over cloud workflow applications   In this paper, we proposed Budget Constrained Priority based Genetic Algorithm \(BCHGA\ to schedule applications to cloud resources that optimize the total cost \( sum of execution cost and data transfer cost\ for running the workflow and also minimize the execution time under the budget constraint. The remaining paper is organized as follow: the related work done in the area of workflow scheduling for distributed computing is 
presented under title Related Work The workflow scheduling model used in experiment is explained in section Workflow Scheduling Model The Standard Genetic Algorithm \(SGA\ and proposed BCHGA are discussed in Section titled Standard Genetic Algorithm and Proposed Algorithm respectively. The proposed BCHGA is evaluated and compared with SGA in section Performance Evaluation and the paper is concluded in section Conclusion and Future Work   RELATED WORK  Workflow scheduling is classical NP-complete problem 
The major grid workflow scheduling algorithms have been classified into two basic categories which are besteffort based scheduling and QoS constraint based scheduling [5  I n tr ad iti o n a l co m m u n i ty b a s e d  computing paradigms, best-effort based scheduling strategies based are often applied to only minimize the execution time without considering the monetary cost since resources are shared freely among system users Many heuristic algorithms such as Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Min-min, and Maxmin are used as candidates for best-effort based scheduling strategies M a ny r e s e a r c h e r s us e d  Genetic Algorithm \(GA\ for task assignment. The 
fitness function of GA is developed to encourage the formation of the solutions to achieve the budget and deadline constraint time minimization of workflow execution in grids while meeting a specified budget for delivering results [9  A H i e r a r c h i c G e ne t i c S c h e du l e r   s de ve l ope d for i m pro vi ng t h e  e f f e c t i v e n e s s o f t h e  single population genetic based scheduler in the dynamic grid environment for scheduling independent jobs. The authors considered the bi-objective independent batch job scheduling problem with

Furthermore, a two phase algorithm, called H2GS ha s  be e n  propos e d fo r t a s k s c he dul i n g i n  heterogeneous processor networks. The first phase implements a heuristic list based algorithm, called LDCP to generate a high quality schedule. In the second phase, this schedule is injected into the initial population of GA, which proceeds to evolve shorter schedules. In [1   t h e a u t hor e m b e dde d t h e e l i t i s m  method  into GA to generate the shorter schedules as well as to decrease the computation time to find the suboptimal schedule as compared to basic GA. The authors further extend their work by improving sub-optimal results using Simulated Annealing \(SA\ [1 by  considering the multiprocessor systems For cloud workflow systems, mainly QoSconstraint based scheduling strategies based on marketoriented business model are required. A compromisedtime-cost scheduling algorithm has been proposed to accommodate transaction-intensive [14  and instanceintensive [1 c o s t c o n s t ra i n e d w orkf l o w s i n c l oud  respectively by compromising execution time and cost with user input enabled on the fly. The algorithm cut down the mean execution cost by over 15% whilst meeting the user-designated deadline or shortens the mean execution time by over 20% within the userdesignated execution cost A market-oriented hierarchical scheduling  strategy [1 has been developed for instance intensive workflow applications to do the workflow scheduling at two levels in cloud environment. A package based random scheduling algorithm has been presented as the candidate servicelevel scheduling algorithm and three representative metaheuristic based scheduling algorithms including GA, Ant Colony Optimization \(ACO\and Particle Swarm optimization\(PSO\ were adapted, implemented and analyzed as the candidate task-level scheduling algorithms under the different QoS constraints However, all these work do not consider different pricing model of cloud environment. Saeid et al  pr opos e d  t w o w orkf l o w s c h e dul i n g  a l g o r i t hm  for cloud environment: one-phase algorithm, IC-PCP and two-phase algorithm, IC-PCPD2. Both algorithms have a polynomial time complexity for scheduling large workflows under deadline constrained. The author considered different type of pricing model for simulation. So we used Genetic Algorithm to schedule workflow applications to cloud resources by considering the pricing model as specified by Amazon [18  I n  th is  paper, we focus on minimizing the execution cost and time while meeting the user specified budget for delivering the result  WORKFLOW SCHEDULING MODEL  A workflow application is modelled by a Directed Acyclic Graph \(DAG\, defined by a tuple G \(T, E  where T is the set of n tasks t 1 t 2 t n  and E is a set of e edges, represent the dependencies. Each t i T  represents a task in the application and each edge t i t j  E represents a precedence constraint, such that the execution of t j  T cannot be started before t i  T finishes its execution  If  t i t j  T then t i is the parent of t j  and t j is the child of t i  A task with no parent is known as an entry task and a task with no children is known as exit task  Basic Definitions  Bottom level \(b-level The b-level of a task is the length of the longest path from the task to a leaf task  T h e b-l e ve l of node i s c a l c ul a t e d a s      1 where w i is the average execution time of the task on the different computing machines succ\(t i  includes all the children tasks of t i  d ij  is the data transmission time from a task t i to t j  If a task has no children, its b-level is equal to the average execution time of the task on the different computing machines Top-level \(t-level The t-level of a task of DAG is defined to be the length of the longest path from the task to the entry task without considering the execution time of  that task [1 a n d i s  gi v e n by t h e fo l l o w i ng e q ua t i on       2 where w i is the average execution time of the task on the different computing machines pred\(t i  includes all the parent tasks of t i   d ij is the data transmission time from a task t i to t j For entry task i.e. a task has no parent, its tlevel is equal to zero Estimated Completion Time \(ECT The ECT is a n x  m matrix where ECT i,j shows the estimated completion time of a task t i on the machine m j The users are charged based upon the number of time intervals that they have used the particular machine. All computation and storage services of service provider are assumed to be in the same physical region, so the average bandwidth between the different available machines is roughly equal [1   An Illustrative Example  Consider a DAG with 11 tasks as shown in Figure 1 Each edge weight of DAG represents the data transmission time between the tasks.Table I shows the expected completion time of various tasks on three different machines. b-level and t-level of all tasks is calculated using equation \(1\ and \(2\ respectively. Then the tasks are sorted in descending order of b-level and in ascending order of t-level to decide the order of execution of all the tasks \(Table II\The tasks are sent to different machines according to their order of execution for completion of workflow application. Figure 2 and 3 shows the schedules generated according to b-level and t-level of DAG respectively

Any solution in the search space of the problem is represented by an individual or chromosome  A  genetic algorithm maintains a population of individuals that evolves over generations towards the better solutions through a repetitive application of genetic operators such as crossover, mutation and selection 21   Th e  q u a li ty o f  an i n d i v i d u al  in th e p o p u l at io n is  determined by a fitness-function.

To evaluate the workflow scheduling algorithm, we used five synthetic workflows based on realistic workflows from diverse scientific applications, which are   Montage: Astronomy  CyberShake: Earthquake  Epigenomics: Biology  LIGO: Gravitational physics  SIPHT: Biology   The detailed characterization for each workflow including their structure and data and computational requirements can be found in [2 F i gure 4 s how s t h e  approximate structure of a small instance of each workflow. The DAX \(Directed Acyclic Graph in XML format for all these workflows are available at [24   from which we have chosen three sizes for our experiment i.e Small \(about 50\, Medium \(about 100 tasks\ and large \(about 1000 tasks  Experiment setup  For our experiment, we have simulated a cloud environment in java The processor speeds of VM’s are selected randomly in the range of 1000-5000 MIPS and price of using these VM’s is set within a range of 2-10 basic units such that fastest VM is roughly five times more expensive than the slowest one. The average bandwidth between these is roughly equal [1 T o  evaluate the impact of time interval on our algorithm we consider long time interval equal to one hour like Amaz    Performance Metrics  The performance metric chosen for the comparison is Normalized Schedule Length \(NSL\. The NSL of a schedule is calculated as        


220   where M c  is the execution time of the same workflow by executing all the tasks on the fastest VM, according their precedence constraints For assigning the budget, first we define the cheapest schedule as scheduling each workflow tasks on the fastest VM, according their precedence constraints considering all data transmission cost as zero. Thus the execution cost of this fastest schedule, denoted by C f is a lower bound for the budget of executing workflow So, the budget for whole workflow is defined as    Budget C f   where is a budget factor in range from 1.5 to 5 For GA, the following parameters are set Parameter Value Initial population 10 Crossover Probability C r  0.7 Mutation probability M r  0.1 Maximum Generation 50    Fig. 4 Structure of Various Workflow   Experiment Result  As GA is a stochastic algorithm, so each algorithm is run for 10 times for each workflow and average value of NSL is used for comparing BCHGA, and SGA.  Figure 5 shows the average NSL of scheduling large workflows with BCHGA, and SGA with time interval equals to one hour. It shows that BCHGA outperforms than the SGA in all cases.  It is clear from the Figure 5\(a\ and 5\(e\ that average NSL for Montage and Cybershake is high as compared to other workflow structures as both of these workflow structure consist of large number of tasks with smaller execution time on fastest VM at the second row thus increasing the overall execution cost of the workflow. For scheduling small and medium size workflow, we are getting the similar graphs    a  Montage    b  Epigemonics    c  SIPHT  0 2 4 6 8 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 NSL  BCHGA SGA 0 2 4 6 8 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 NSL  BCHGA SGA 0 2 4 6 8 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 NSL  BCHGA SGA

Each workflow’s task is assigned priority using bottom level and top level. These priorities are then used to create the initial population of BCHGA The proposed algorithm is evaluated with synthetic workflows that are based on realistic workflows with different structures and different sizes. These algorithms also consider the pay-as-you-use pricing model of current commercial cloud like Amazon. The comparison of proposed algorithms is d one with SGA under same budget constraint and pricing model. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithms have promising performance as compared to SGA. In future we intend to improve our work for the real cloud environment including other QoS constraints and comparison can be made with other meta-heuristic techniques like PSO and ACO etc   REFERENCES 1  Foster I., Zhao Y., Raicu L., and Lu S. \(2008 Cloud computing and grid computing 360-degree compared’, in Proceeding of Grid Computing Environment Workshop, Austin, pp.1-10  2  Verma A., and Kaushal S. \(2011\: ‘Cloud computing security issues and challenges: a survey’, in Proceeding of 1st International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications, PartIV, Kochi, India, July 22-24.

 13 continuity  The weather and climate models used by forecasters and scientists in the United States and throughout the world rely heavily on data from NASA-developed and NOAAoperated polar-orbiting satellites.  The continuity of that data is critical.  Without these satellite observations advance notice of extreme events would be diminished Accurate three to ten day forecasts allow businesses, Federal and state governments, and the American public to prepare for severe weather events, reducing personal injury and death, safeguarding property, live stock and cutting the length of time businesses are shut down.  For example: The path of an anticipated hurricane, its accompanying storm surge, and the coastal flood potential are critical inputs to the decisions necessary to conduct safe and strategic evacuations of coastal residents.  Conversely, inaccurate forecasts can lead to needless and costly evacuations that undermine the public\222s confidence in weather warnings, and ultimately compromise evacuation response in the face of a real emergency.  Further inland, accurate rainfall forecasts are essential to mitigate against flash flooding and mudslides  Data continuity over decades, and across multiple and diverse Earth Science Missions, is providing, for the first time, the ability to look at our planet as a system and to correlate changes within these data sets with observed climate trends.  The NASA Earth Observing System's weather instruments have enabled the first improvement in weather forecasting skill in more than a decade.  Over the last twelve years, instruments on NASA\222s Terra and Aqua satellites have provided the first global measurements of aerosols in our atmosphere, which come from natural sources such as volcanoes and dust storms.  Other instruments onboard the Aura satellite study the processes that regulate the abundance of ozone in the atmosphere Data from the GRACE and ICESat missions, as well as from spaceborne radar, are used to monitor trends in thickness of the Earth\222s polar ice sheets, while the Jason-1 and Jason-2 missions are recording fluctuations in sea level Together, data integrated from all of these missions provide our scientists with a system level view of our planet\222s ecosystems and the interactions impacting weather and climate on a global scale  Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA\ have a mandate under the Clean Air Act to monitor ozone-depleting gases and stratospheric depletion of ozone.  A recent joint study performed by NASA and NOAA has shown that the average area covered by the Antarctic ozone hole in 2012 was the second smallest in the last 20 years, while a study in 2011 showed that the amount of ozone destroyed in the Arctic in 2011 was comparable to that seen in some years in the Antarctic where an ozone "hole" has formed each spring since the mid-1980s  NASA and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer via ground measurements and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s.  Long-term ozone monitoring instruments have included TOMS, SBUV/2 Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment series of instruments, the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, and the Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite \(OMPS\strument on Suomi NPP.  Arctic ozone loss has been measured with daily global observations of trace gases and clouds from NASA's Aura and CALIPSO spacecraft.  Ozone is critical to protect the Earth from harmful radiation, and continuing to develop and fund space instruments to measure ozone is necessary to predict future ozone amounts.  The Decadal Survey included a mission called the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission GACM\ continue this study of ozone  Through the use of continuous data, the United States and partnering nations share, converge on and establish the guidelines necessary to manage their resources, reduce pollutants and continue to give their people the quality of life we all currently enjoy  9  C ONCLUSIONS AND R ECOMMENDATIONS   In 2011 the NRC revisited the Decadal Survey report and published a Midterm Assessment Report.  This report stated 223NASA responded favorably and aggressively to the decadal survey, embracing its overall recommendations for Earth observations, missions, technology investments, and priorities for the underlying science.  As a consequence, the science and applications communities have made significant progress over the past 5 y T h i s paper s u mm ari zed  the foundation missions which were in place at the time of the Decadal Survey and the cooperative science realized by flying these satellites in coordinated mission orbits known as the A Train and Morning Constellations. It discussed the systematic way NASA identified the science observations necessary to address the full range of Earth Science questions, and the importance of maintaining scientific breadth.  It presented the new paradigm of developing instruments through multiple programs and decoupling that development from the eventual assembly of instruments and spacecraft to form a mission.  It stressed that for NASA to achieve the goal of developing and flying the missions defined in the Decadal Survey there must be continued funding, available, appropriately sized launch vehicles and a strong supplier base.   The consequences of not having these key elements are a gap in data continuity and a delay in answering the key Earth science questions involved in basic Earth stewardship  Within the next couple of years it is expected that there will be another Decadal Survey.  Given the budget outlook for Earth Science and NASA, there should be a recommendation to shrink the size of the instruments as much as possible while still gaining valuable observations 


 14 Then, recognizing that flying smaller payloads on traditional launch vehicles will be very wasteful, there should be a recommendation to encourage th e efforts that have been started to utilize non-traditional methods of launching instruments including hosting them on commercial satellites, combining them into larger missions that fill the launch vehicle, or sharing rides to space \226 all concepts designed to match up the size of the payload with the size of the launch vehicle.  Lastly, some consideration should be given to the on-orbit architecture of the next generation of missions \226 should they be organized into coordinated orbits such as the Afternoon Constellation and the Morning Constellation, or be put into individual orbits that maximize specific science observations, as the Tier 1 and 2 missions are doing?  Are there other constellation architectures to be explored?  Despite a steady or declining budget outlook, a future with smaller, nimble satellites sharing launch vehicles and cooperating via newly developed constellation architectures could yield a very exciting future for Earth Science  Acknowledgements 227 George Andrew, John Carey, Pete Cline, Ed Hatter, and Carey Lively provided valuable contributions in the writing of this paper  R EFERENCES   1  NASA 2010 Science Plan for NASA\222s Science Mission Directorate NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C    C o u r tes y of Dr. Ste v en P l at n i c k N A S A GS FC  3  Earth Science and Applications from Space National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond The National Academies Press, Washington D.C., 2007  4  Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Midterm Assessment of NASA's Implementation of the Decadal Survey The National Academies Press Washington D.C., 2012   C E N R  I WG EO  2005 Strategic Plan for the U.
