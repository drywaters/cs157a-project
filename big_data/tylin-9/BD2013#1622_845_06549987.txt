Electrical and Computer Engineering The University of British Columbia Vancouver BC Canada Email vleung@ece.ubc.ca Abstract 227Planet scale growth in deployment of mobile and interconnected devices interacting in a participatory sensing collection and dissemination of information have motivated interest in the Internet of Things Therefore the problem of information overload and big data becomes inherent In this paper we intend to propose a methodology aiming at a lower processing overhead towards an energy ef\002cient method for networking of information in larger systems We consider a content-centric networking paradigm that is aimed at enhancing the dissemination of information and eliminating many problems of host based communication The proposed method is based on a network coding approach which leverages the spectral characteristics of network topology We argue that topology of interacting nodes within a cluster can in\003uence the performance of network coding from a computational complexity perspective and therefore the overall energy consumption in a system We propose an algorithm that takes an opportunistic strategy to utilize the social structure and spectral characteristics of the network topology based on our design of a multicast coding network that reduces the number of encoding nodes I I NTRODUCTION The emergence of cloud computing and rapid increase in creation and dissemination of information over the Internet evolved the society to consider the Internet as a source of information and services that is delivered to them by the network The future internet is facing the problem of information overload and the existing networking solutions may not be able to cope with the rapid increase in the amount of information available Cyber physical systems and ubiquity of sensors devices and embedded systems has lead to the transition towards the networking of information as opposed to networking of devices This calls for a transition from an end-to-end communication paradigm to a content-based networking paradigm The potential of this shift in the Internet architecture could be signi\002cant since it impacts both the communication model and the network infrastructure Contentbased networking also known as content-aware Contentcentric Networking CCN information-centric or dataoriented networking aims at using the network layer to provide content to the users instead of providing a communication channel between hosts While this shift in the networking paradigm is advantageous there are challenges associated with dissemination of information for larger scale systems Current host based networking solution may not cope with intermittent connectivity and reliable transport of relevant data A number of research projects in Europe and North America are also investigating the content-centric approach for the future internet and propose a data-centric architecture for the future internet Examples are PSIRP CCN 1 NetInf 3 4WARD and DON A 5 Although the y all dif fer in their architecture designs they share the same goal in developing a content distribution approach to cope with heterogeneity of networks disruptions and disconnections In content-based communication information will be targeted towards a speci\002c set of interested nodes rather than hosts that are identi\002ed by their location This shift in paradigm can be described with the past trend in networks from circuit switched networks to packet switched networks and then to a content centric paradigm In circuit switched networks for any end-to-end communication there is a dedicated connection With the increased demand in telephony Voice over IP VoIP and data communication circuit switched solution was no longer suf\002cient In the packet switched approach data items move in separate smaller blocks called packets or datagrams according to the destination address and other identi\002ers in the packet Similar trend implies that the existing IP-based connection approach may not be suf\002cient in response to the increasing demand for content leading the way to a shift in paradigm where the end points of communication are no longer relevant and transparent Current method of communication is based on a conversational model of interaction The distinction between dissemination and conversation lies on the fact that it is important to disseminate data to relevant requester and making the underlying mechanism agnostic As long as the request is satis\002ed it is not important where it comes from A Contribution In this paper we identify the challenge of big data problem for large systems as applicable to the Internet of Things IoT and cyber physical systems in the future internet We argue that it can be solved by changing the networking paradigm towards the idea of network of information We intend to propose an energy ef\002cient solution to dissemination of information for 978-1-4673-3108-1/13/$31.00 ©2013

large systems Our proposed algorithm is based on an opportunistic approach to perform network coding on selected nodes within a cluster The decision is made by taking the social connectivity of participating nodes into account We argue that knowing about the spectral characteristics of topology can assist in an energy ef\002cient design of multicast coding network which yields to limiting the number of encoding nodes One of the overheads with network coding is that nodes must have the processing capability to perform arithmetic operations over a 002nite 002eld in real time This processing will determine whether a decoded content chunk is innovative and makes a decision to either encode forward or decode The following criteria contribute to the computational cost Number of nodes that perform network coding number of operations and number of transmitted packets II R ELATED W ORK Energy ef\002cient data dissemination has been investigated in the context of sensor networks A location aided method is proposed in with a protocol that is based on the location information to reduce redundant transmissions A recent work in addressed ener gy ef 002cienc y in data dissemination for the internet of things Another work proposed an algorithm that supports transmission of spatial data and process queries based on their location The advantages of network coding for energy ef\002ciency have been investigated in the literature Authors in investigated bene\002ts of network coding in terms of energy ef\002ciency and showed that network coding can offer more ef\002cient broadcasting over ad hoc wireless networks They have shown that network coding can be advantageous while it offers a constant gain over a 002xed topology and a log n factor of bene\002t over a network with dynamic topology Another paper proposed a netw ork codi n g based broadcast method by combining network coding with the Connected Dominating Set CDS broadcasting The intuition behind their proposed scheme is to intersect information 003ows at nodes in CDS to increase the coding opportunities The traditional approach to content distribution in large networks is based on the end-to-end client server approach Content Delivery Distribution Networks CDN aim at minimizing the request response time to deliver the content to users They perform in a distributed client server approach by caching the content items in some geographically distributed servers e.g Akamai Peer-to-Peer P2P networks also offer a distributed and collaborative architecture for content distribution In a collaborative content dissemination model a population of users are interested in retrieving a content item while the server capabilities and resources are limited Therefore the content items are split into blocks of information and disseminated to users and users collaboratively reconstruct the items by exchanging the blocks of information e.g BitTorrent The problem of content dissemination has been studied from the perspective of coding complexity in The authors use the LT-based network coding approach to achieve a better decoding performance for situations where nodes posses less processing capabilities such as sensor networks Content dissemination problem in content-centric networking is approached by with a solution based on a directed diffusion method according to the interest in a content item from the nearest location that is aimed at improving the robustness against network failures and disruptions A content routing protocol is proposed by ai med to be adaptable to large scale networks This method is based on request 002ltering and content dissemination and the design is based on achieving a compromise between the matching ef\002ciency and the cost of communication III C ONTENT C ENTRIC N ETWORKING Independent of any speci\002c architecture there are common components that are important as building blocks of a contentcentric networking paradigm 017 Content is referred to any type and volume of raw data that can be combined mixed or aggregated to generate new content 017 Information object Information is a higher level abstraction of raw data that can be obtained by aggregating processing mixing of data 017 Naming can be looked at in the context of node model in CCN According to there are tw o CCN pack et types Interest packet and Data packet  017 Routing and transport In CCN routing is based on the name of the content Transport in CCN is designed to operate on top of unreliable packet delivery service There are mechanisms that can prevent looping and duplicate of interest packets 017 Security In CCN the idea of content-based security is adapted where protection and trust is embedded in the content instead of securing the communication channel In CCN the node model consists of two types of packets First type is called Interest packets and and the other is called Data packets  Interest packets are broadcast to available connected neighbors for the purpose of querying a data packet A data packet satis\002es an interest if the pre\002x of the contentName 002eld in the data packet matches the contentName 002eld of the interest packet IV P ROPOSED M ETHOD Network coding is a general case of routing In network coding approach a linear combination of received packets are transmitted at the egress while routing only performs a forwarding with no arithmetic operations performed Inherent multipath support in a content-centric networking paradigm makes network coding a suitable approach The results presented in ar gue that linear coding with 002nite base 002eld suf\002ces to achieve the Max-\003ow Min-cut bound for multicast Another advantage of network coding is energy ef\002ciency as discussed in The k e y ingredient of our approach is le v er aging the spectral characteristics of network for selecting the key player nodes for performing network coding Speci\002cally we show that in the networks with good expansion properties 


our decentralized approach yields a better reliability and less computational cost The motivation behind the proposed method is that with a content-centric networking architecture network coding can be deployed for a better utilization of redundant capacity On the other hand information about the spectral characteristics of chosen clusters can be utilized for a more ef\002cient data dissemination based on social interaction and connectivity of participating nodes A Spectral Characteristics of Network Topology For a 002nite undirected graph G   V E   the adjacency matrix A G is de\002ned as A ij  032 1 if i and j are adjacent 0 otherwise For the adjacency matrix A G of graph G and the identity matrix I and 025 being a scalar then the determinant j A G 000 025I j which is called the characteristic polynomial of A G  The roots of j A G 000 025I j  0 are called the eigenvalues of G  Considering the network topology de\002ned earlier as a graph G   V E   the spectrum of the graph is the set of the eigenvalues 025 1  025 2   025 k of the adjacency matrix of the graph The spectral gap of G is de\002ned as  d 000 025 2   The spectral gap of a graph is a measure of the spectral expansion of that graph It is assumed that such graphs are connected Different connected graphs have different spectral parameters In this work we are interested in high expansion parameters and lower degrees The Laplacian of graph G is de\002ned as L G where L ij  8   d i if i  j 000 A ij if i 6  j and  i j  is an edge 0 Otherwise The Laplacian L G has at least one zero eigenvalue and their multiplicity is an indication of the number of disjoint paths in a graph B Model We base our model of information 003ow at the content chunk level rather than the IP packet level In this paradigm data chunks for a content item can be received from multiple sources and nodes with different constraints and characteristics In the following we brie\003y go over some of the preliminaries We consider the network as a directed graph G   V E  where V is the set of vertices nodes and E is the set of edges links A link l 2 E can be thought of a a pair  i j  2 E representing the link from node i to node j  where node j is the destination and node i is the source of link l   i j  2 E  The network performs linear operations and linear coding on the 003ow of information Therefore it can be represented as a state space description consisting of the coupling at the source and destination as well as the adjacency matrix of the graph as the following standard form Y  F X  BU Z  AX 1 where Y denotes the intermediate random processes F is adjacency matrix of the graph for the network B describes the coupling between the source nodes to the network and A describes the coupling of the system to the sink nodes The following describes the above mentioned matrices For each source i  the 1 002 j E j matrix A i can be de\002ned as A i;j  032 a i;l j if l j 2  out  s i  0 otherwise where  out is the outdegree edge and  in is the indegree edge The coupling at the destinations is described as B i;j  032 b l j i if l j 2  in  z i  0 otherwise and 002nally the matrix describing the network can be written as F i;j  032 f l i l j if head  l i   tail  l j  i.e adjacent 0 otherwise The global transfer matrix M for the system can be written as follows M  A  I 000 F  000 1 B T 2 where I is the j E j 002 j E j identity matrix We assume that any of the interfaces can act as egress if there is another node connected with an interest on any speci\002c content It implies that not all nodes are required to be a CCN node but it may suf\002ce to act as a relay node Forwarding at each node is performed as follows 1 At the initial time the source sends data chunk i of popularity class k to all the faces con\002gured as egress 2 We assume that based on the CCN approach if identical chunks are received at the incident links only one chunk will be considered for forwarding or coding 3 An intermediate node that performs coding should have the following condition The indegree of v should be greater than the outdegree of v i.e d 000  v   d   v   In other words there are more incident links acting as ingress than egress 4 Any node known as a CCN router will perform the random linear coding on the received chunks and forwards via eligible egress faces Assuming that the router is content-aware it will forward to the interfaces incident to nodes that are interested in the content item Step 3 ensures a less computational cost on any two clusters where the receivers are at one end by introducing a lower rank at the intermediate step In the above mentioned the intuition is 002nding the best expander graph for a cluster One of deterministic measures of expansion is the Cheeger constant  of a graph that can be de\002ned as follo ws h  C   j   X  j vol  X  where   X  is the edge boundary of X and de\002ned as   X   ff u v g 2 E  u 2 X v  2 X g 


In our proposed solution we are interested in clusters that possess a greater degree of expansion yielding a higher connectivity and lower complexity for a large system In other words a good expander implies a linear growth of the number of edges with the size of network h G  max C 032 G h  C  We demonstrate in the next section that by minimizing the solution to the best expander we will succeed in minimizing the number of nodes with higher processing demand It can be done by leveraging the spectral characteristics of the topology that is inferred by the social structure of participating nodes Since the intermediate nodes are content aware knowledge about type of content and predicate of requested content can help in determining the receivers with common set of queries Let 013 denote the data chunk distinction factor indicating the number of distinct data chunks in terms of attributes as in the CCN interest packet Each CCN node taking the responsibility of encoding and forwards the data chunks to the interfaces according to the received interest packet queries It can be shown that by selectively encoding of packets based on their targeted receivers the maximum number of encoding nodes can be signi\002cantly reduced V A NALYSIS AND D ISCUSSION In this section we discuss the impact of CCN as a networking paradigm In addition the impacts of complexity and processing cost on the performance of system is analyzed A Content Distribution Ef\002ciency The ef\002ciency of content dissemination in CCN arises with the situation of larger number receivers and sink nodes The experiment done in has sho wn that TCP scales linearly with increasing the number of sink nodes while CCN follows a constant scale Since TCP traf\002c is per connection as the number of connections increase download completion time gets larger However in the CCN approach the traf\002c would cross the path only once As discussed and evaluated in it is important to consider that although the performance penalty of using CCN due to its packet overhead vs TCP is around 20 the performance gain for the case of larger sink nodes is integer multiples B Complexity The processing cost for a network coding based approach in large systems can be extensive since nodes must have the processing capability to perform arithmetic operations over 002nite 002elds in real time This processing will determine whether a decoded content chunk is innovative and makes a decision to either encode forward or decode The processing complexity involved in operations over 002elds depends on the size of each generation h  and size of the 002eld n  It takes O  h 2  operations in F 2 n for linear operations with generations of size h  Multiplications and inversions over 002eld F 2 n is of complexity O  n 2   Furthermore matrix inversions and Gaussian elimination to solve the system takes O  h 3   Fig 1 Rank factorization yielding O  r  m  n  When the random network coding approach is chosen the probability of success at the destination is also a critical factor in addition to the processing complexity Breaking the system into clusters and performing network coding selectively on nodes or clusters can reduce the complexity by means of rank factorization as shown in Figure 1 Therefore the complexity in such approach is O  r  m  n  as opposed to the other case where complexity is O  mn   Therefore in choosing the right cluster the intermediate rank r is an important factor The complexity of encoding is affected by the number of nodes that are required to perform network coding The number of nodes that are required to perform coding in order to deliver h packets to a set of k terminals is bounded by h 3 k 2  In a gossip based algorithm for network coding the maximum number of encoding nodes for 013 distinct data chunks is O  013 3 h 3 k 2   By cluster based selective encoding approach of CCN the rank of this system will be factorized to O  013h 3 k 2   Fig 2 Maximum number of encoding nodes with respect to the number of data items The expansion factor of a graph can be described as the minimum 224surface-to-volume\224 ratio of any subset of nodes and can be represented by the measures of expansion Let f denote this measure of expansion f  min X 032 V j   X  j min fj X j  j X jg

the future internet It constitutes a large system with a large amount of participating nodes A context-aware methodology for utilizing the topology of information can lead to a more ef\002cient

evaluation. We performed two types of Hadoop benchmark grep and wordcount. We compared Hadoop original version which run only on host CPU, and accelerated version   TABLE II  S PECIFICATION OF OUR SERVER CPU Intel Xeon E5-1660 \(3.3GHz, 6-cores, HT Memory 128GB \(DDR3-1600, 16GBx8 HDD\(SATA\ 7200rpm \(1TB Network\(eth 1000Base-T \(On board OS CentOS 6.3 \(x86_64 Java VM Oracle JDK 6 Update 38 Hadoop CDH3 update4  A  Grep First we performed the Grep benchmark. We used a 50GB randomly generated dictionary, and searched for words that matched the regular expression /^a{4}/. Only one word matched this regular expression in the 50GB dictionary, which means that this is a Map task heavy benchmark.  To fairly compare the two methods, we did not use Grep sample implementation included in the Hadoop distribution. We implemented a very simple grep mapreduce program using the java standard tokenizer to split words and regex to check the regular expression. The 50GB data was loaded on the memory file system to eliminate the I/O bottleneck of storage. Figure 16 shows the results. The execution time of the original version was 211 seconds which corresponds to 242MB/s per node. This means that even for the SATA based SSD, we cannot fully utilize the I/O. On the other hand, the hardware accelerated version took 44 seconds, which corresponds to 1163 MB/s.  This means that we can fully utilize the I/O of at least two SATA based SSDs           Figure 16. Grep benchmark results  B  Wordcount The next benchmark used the Wordcount program. We used a 20GB random text file generated from a small dictionary and counted the number of occurrences of each word. We enabled the combiner in Map Task in the following all measurements. The size of output file was 3.6MB and the number of keys was 235,834. This means that the combiner was effective, and the size of the Map output file was relatively small so that this was also Map task heavy benchmark. As for the hardware accelerated version, we performed two types of experiments; host side merge was enabled and disabled. Figure 17 shows the results. The execution time of the original version was 1050 seconds which corresponds to 19MB/s per node. The hardware accelerated version with host side merge took 163 seconds which corresponds to 125 MB/s. And, the hardware accelerated version without host side merge took 200 seconds, which corresponds to 102 MB/s          Figure 17. Wordcount benchmark results  C  Discussion The results of the above benchmark experiment show the feasibility of our proposal. In this experiment, we used only one acceleration board which implemented one CPU with has 36 cores. We can seamlessly increase the performance by increasing the number of boards depending on the performance needed Note that the SPECint benchmark score of the host CPU Intel Xeon E5-1660 3.3GHz 6core, 12HT\ and the manycore CPU \(Tilera TILEncore-GX36 1.0GHz 36core comparable, so that the MapReduce benchmark results should be also comparable. However, hardware accelerated version overwhelmed the original version. This must be due to the overhead of Java. If we implement a C version of MapReduce, we can achieve performance comparable to the hardware accelerated results given above In terms of power consumption, our approach is superior Power consumption of the host CPU used in this experiment was 130W. On the other hand, TILEncore-Gx36 used only 35W. Of course, our prototype implementation used both the acceleration board and that host CPU, so this comparison is not exactly fair.  However, as for Grep, the original version had throughput of 1.86MB/W while the hardware accelerated version achieved 46.5MB/W As for the wordcount experimental results, we could not realize the situation where the bandwidth of the storage devices was fully utilized. Though the throughput of the tasks implemented on the Tilera board was relatively fast merging the sorted file in the map and reduce task was slow Thus the total throughput was not high enough to fully utilize the storage devices. To fully eliminate the CPU bottleneck in MapReduce, we also have to solve this problem. This is our future work, and we are going to improve the merge part by implementing a new hardware accelerator 123 


VII  R ELATED W ORK  Hadoop MapReduce has been benchmarked by many researchers. For example, Dawei Jang et al. investigated the performance bottleneck of Hadoop MapReduce, and pointed out five design factors that affect the performance of Hadoop On e of th e m is d a ta pars in g  T h e y poin t ed ou t that immutable decoding incurred high performance overhead. Edward Mazur et al. proposed a platform for scalable one-pass analytics using MapRedu th eir study, which concentrated on CPU utilization, they performed a benchmark test of Hadoop MapReduce. They observed that the sorting step incurs high CPU cost Moreover, they also pointed out that the CPUs are busy even for the simple map task, which simply extracts user id from each click record and emits key-value pairs. Matei Zahria et al. proposed the use of distributed shared memory called RDD, to accelerate MapReduce. In their paper, they pointed out data load \(deserialization\ was a CPU heavy task As for hardware acceleration, several studies are known Most offload the numerical calculations of the map and reduce task. Yolanda Becerra et al. offload CPU intensive calculations to an acceleration board implemented as an IBM Cell BE processo  Th e y  s h o w ed th a t C P U intensive operations such as data encryption were improved However, they could not improve the throughput of data intensive operations due to the communication and synchronization overhead. Bingsheng He et al. proposed Mars, which uses a GPGPU to accelerate MapRedu They also improved the CPU intensive operations by using a GPGPU. The last one is slightly different from others Exar Corp. has developed a hardware acceleration board that supports data compression and decompression T h e purpose of their product is to reduce the I/O bottleneck, and lower CPU utilization Another type of benchmark study was done by Sayantan Sur et al. [10  B y usi n g I n fi n i b a nd a s a hi g h sp e e d ne t w o r k  they could improve the performance of HDFS. However they also noticed that SSD can improve the performance of MapReduce. Yondong Wang et al. proposed an efficient merge approach by using RDMA of Infiniban  VIII  S UMMARY  In this paper, we conducted a performance study of Hadoop MapReduce. We showed that the CPU will become the bottleneck given the adoption of state-of-the-art storage and networking devices. To overcome the anticipated CPU bottleneck without significantly altering the MapReduce framework, we proposed a hardware acceleration approach We implemented a prototype using a many core processor board developed by Tilera, and showed the feasibility of our proposal R EFERENCES   1  J.

The performance of BFS and triangle counting are dependent on topological properties of the graph For BFS the performance is dependent on the diameter the longest shortest-path of the graph Using the Small World graph vs traditional 1D partitioning we show the weak scaling of both with BFS on RMAT graphs on BG/P in Figure 12 Because 1D partitioning suffers from data imbalance the graph sizes in the experiments were reduced to prevent 1D from running out of memory The weak scaling of edge list partitioning is almost linear while 
vertices twice the size as experiments on BG/P Intrepid We expect our approach to continue scaling as larger HPC clusters with node-local NVRAM become available To experiment with the effects of increasing NVRAM usage per compute node we performed an experiment where the computational resources are held constant while the data size increases The results of our data scaling experiment are shown in Figure 9 As the data size increases from 34 billion to 1 trillion edges 10.8 TB the additional data we store on NVRAM results in only a moderate performance reduction The overall performance reduction from DRAMonly to 32x larger graph stored in NVRAM is only 39 This is a signi“cant increase in data size with only a moderate performance degradation Results using our distributed external memory BFS for the Graph500 are shown in Table II In addition to the HyperionDIT cluster we performed experiments on Trestles at the San Diego Supercomputing Center SDSC and Leviathan LLNL Each compute node in Trestles has commodity SATA SSDs and shows that our approach is not limited to enterprise class NVRAM Leviathan is a single-node system using implementations from our previous multithreaded work  4  Le viathan has 1TB of DRAM and 12TB of Fusion-io in a single host These represent 3 of 8 total systems on the November 2011 Graph500 list traversing trillion-edge graphs To demonstrate the effects of

vertices and undirected edges We performed a weak scaling study in which each compute node stores 17 billion edges on its local NVRAM roughly 169GB in a compressed sparse row format The results of the weak scaling are shown in Figure 8 at 64 compute nodes the graph has over one trillion undirected edges and probabilities shown above each datapoint Maximum vertex degree used for x-axis Computational resources xed at 4096 cores of BG/P Graph size is xed at vertices and 
vertices and undirected edges undirected edges per core generator we show the effects of increasing diameter on BFS in Figure 10 By decreasing the small-world random rewire probability while keeping the size of the graph constant the diameter of the graph increases The increasing diameter causes the performance of BFS to decrease Similarly the performance of triangle counting is dependent on the maximum vertex degree Using the Preferential Attachment graph generator with an added step of random rewire we show the effects of increasing hub degree while keeping the graph size constant in Figure 11 The topological effects can also be seen in the algorithm analysis in Sections VI-D 1 and VI-D 3

We experimented with the effects on BFS performance of choosing different size on a graph with vertices on 4096 cores of BG/P The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 13 where the percent improvement of ghosts per partition vs no ghosts is shown Using a single ghost shows more than a 12 improvement and 512 ghosts shows an 19.5 improvement This improvement is highly dependent on the graph and as hubs grow to larger sizes it may have a larger effect For scale-free graphs when  there is an opportunity for ghosts to have a positive effect because at least one partition will have multiple edges to  where is the number of distributed partitions and is the graph For the sparse Graph500 datasets with average degree of 16 this may occur for as low as 256 partitions and is independent of graph size Second under weak scaling the amount of algorithm state e.g BFS level stored per partition scales with  where is the total number of vertices This will ultimately hit a scaling wall where the amount of local algorithm state per partition exceeds the capacity of the compute node Finally with respect to our desire to use semi-external memory where the vertex set is stored in in-memory and the edge set is stored in external memory hypersparse partitions are poor candidates to apply semi-external memory techniques because the in-memory requirements proportional to the number of vertices are larger than the external memory requirements proportional to the number of edges Our has been explored by Willcock  20  Acti v e messages are routed through a synthetic network to improve dense communication scalability A key difference to our work is that their approach has been designed for the Bulk Synchronous Parallel BSP model and is not suitable for asynchronous graph traversals The STAPL Graph Library  21  pro vides a frame w ork that abstracts the user from data-distribution and parallelism and supports asynchronous algorithms to be expressed 
Recent work using 2D graph partitioning has shown the best results for traditional large scale HPC systems  3   10   11  Ho we v er  it has serious disadv antages at scale and with external memory First when processing sparse graphs each 2D block may become hypersparse i.e fewer edges than vertices per partition  19  Speci“cally  partitions become hypersparse when
