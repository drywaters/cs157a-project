 Abstract 227Cloud services are fundamentally supported by Data Center Networks \(DCNs\. With the fast growth of cloud services, the scale of DCNs increases rapidly, leading to a big concern on system scalability due to multiple constraints. Based on optical switching and transmission, this paper proposes a scalable DCN architecture with distributed placement of optical switches and server racks at different nodes in a given optical network. This solves the scalability issue by relaxing power and cooling constraints, and reducing the number of \(electronic switches using high-capacity optical switches, as well as simplifying internal connections of the DCN using wavelengths in the optical network. Moreover, the distributed optical switches provide service access interfaces to demands in vicinities, and thus reduce the transmission cost of the external traffic. The major concern is the additional delay and cost for remote transmissions of the DCN internal traffic. To this end, we study the component placement problem in DCNs under a given set of external demands and internal traffic patterns. By leveraging among multiple conflicting factors such as scalability and internal overhead of the DCN as well as the transmission cost of external traffic, we propose an ILP \(Integer Linear Program\ to minimize the overall cost of a DCN while sa tisfying all service demands in the network. This addresses both scalability and cost minimization issues from a network point of view Keywords-Cloud services, data center networks \(DCNs\, optical switching, placement, scalability I   I NTRODUCTION  Most of the existing and emerging cloud services are provided by Data Center Networks \(DCNs\[1-3  Bas i cal l y a DCN is a factory-scale and massively parallel computing and storage resources. It consists of a huge number of servers organized in racks, which work in parallel with data exchange via a switch network such as Clos [4 a t T r e e 7 9 With the rapid growth of cloud services, the scale of DCNs is getting large with exponentially increased number of servers   T h e fa st s c a l e e x p a nsi o n o f D C N s  l e a d s t o a bi g co nce r n  on system scalability, which is constrained by many environmental factors such as site and warehouse choice system cooling, power supply capacity, as well as energy efficiency and carbon dioxide footprint, etc Other than environmental factors, scalability is constrained by the internal architecture of DCNs as well. Existing DCNs generally adopt electronic switches and routers with multiple stages of O/E and E/O transceivers, leading to bandwidth bottleneck and high power consumption, as well as complex interconnects and bulky systems due to the limited modular switching capacity and thus a large number of switches and ports. On the other hand, it is shown that over 70% power can be saved in DCNs if electronic switches are further replace by optical ones D u e  t o  t h e hi gh sw i t c hi ng c a p a ci t y o f  o p t i c a l  switches, the number of switches can be decreased as well to reduce the system size with much enlarged system bandwidth In recent years, several all-optical or hybrid electricaloptical switches have been demonstrated, including c-Through Helios, DOS, Proteus, Petabit and IRIS, etc. A complete survey on this can be found in [12   A l l o f  t h o s e o p t i c a l sw i t c he s t a r g et  at possible applications in future high performance DCNs Though optical switches generally have a reconfiguration overhead for adjusting the tunable optical components and synchronizing the system, performance guaranteed switching i.e., no packet loss and packet delay is bounded\ can be achieved using the state-of-the-art traffic scheduling algorithms 13-16  In  th is p a p e r  w e ad o p t o p t i ca l sw itch e s in th e p r o p o s e d  architecture As the current architecture is not viable for future high performance DCNs, it is desirable to cluster the server racks and switches into multiple sets \(defined as component sets nd put them at different places, especially different nodes in an optical network \(municipal, regional or national\ As such power supply, system cooling and warehouse accommodation can be handled in a distributed and less bulky manner, and wavelengths in the optical network can be used to provide DCN internal interconnects Challenges also exist. First, placing optical switches and racks at different network nodes introduces additional delay to the DCN internal traffic due to optical transmissions in fibers which is about 5ms per 1000km. The delay is generally tolerable in municipal or regional area networks, but could be notable if the switches and racks are separated across a few thousands kilometers in a national area network. In the latter case, the proposed idea can be used for more delay-tolerant DCN processes, such as file replication in GFS \(Google File System\ [1 n d  M a p R ed uc e  18  Another issue is the long-haul transmission cost of the DCN internal traffic.

 19 in tern al traff i c i n c u rren t DCNs is ab o u t f o u r ti m e s m o re  than the external traffic. While distributed placement increases the transmission cost of internal traffic, it may also reduce that of external traffic \(for service requests and delivery\ due to the distributed DCN service interfaces placed closer to clients. As a result, finding a suitable set of nodes to place proper component sets is an important issue for balancing internal and external transmission costs of the DCN. Meanwhile, it is desirable that a component set \(placed at a single node consists of those racks with heavy inter-rack traffic, while leaving light-loaded internal traffic for long-haul transmissions So, rack clustering is also an important issue. Those factors make system cost minimization a very complex yet interesting optimization problem In this paper, we propose a scalable DCN architecture with distributed placement of optical switches and racks in a given optical network. As mentioned above, this solves the current centralized power supply and system cooling issues and simplifies DCNs by using high-capacity optical switches and high-speed wavelength connections embedded in the optical network, as well as reducing power consumption of the DCN To support the proposed architecture, we further study the switch and rack \(i.e., component\ placement problem with predefined external demands and internal traffic pattern of the DCN. An ILP \(Integer Linear Program\ is proposed to solve the placement problem with the objective of minimizing the overall system cost while scaling the DCN. The long-haul transmission delay of the DCN internal traffic is translated into a countable cost factor, such that it can be taken into account in the overall cost minimization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the proposed architecture and the placement problem Section III formulates the ILP for optimally solving the problem Numerical results are presented in Section IV. We conclude the paper in Section V II  A RCHITECTURE AND P ROBLEM  A. The Proposed Architecture As discussed in Section I, our key idea is to spread the DCN component sets over a certain area of the network. Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed architecture, where the components inside a dashed ellipse form a component set to be placed at a single node. Basically, the network nodes denoted by the ellipses and the inter-node fiber connections are embedded in the optical network, and the DCN in the rectangle is just to show the functionality of the components in a logical manner Besides, it is possible that the content and core switches are placed at the same node as the server racks and aggregation switches, though they appear to be separate in Fig. 1. This depends on the cost minimization process as discussed later In Fig. 1, the ToR \(Top-of-Rack\and content switches are electronic routers or OpenFlow sw i t c he s, w h e r e a s  t h e aggregation and core switches are optical crossbar or packet switching fabrics. An aggregation switch is always collocated with a set of server racks at the same node and is responsible for data switching among them, and the traffic in the same rack is switched by the ToR switch. The content and core switches are always collocated. The former provides service interfaces for external requests and the latter for inter-node data switching of the DCN internal traffic. The core and aggregation switches are interconnected by optical wavelengths and fibers. Logically they form a typical multi-stage switch network based on foldedClos \(or Fat-Tree\ructure [7-9  Traffic is divided into external traffic \(for service requests and delivery\nd DCN internal traffic by content switches Each node in the network has a specific amount of service demands, which can be served by a nearby content switch to minimize the external transmission cost. Nevertheless, routing demands to different content switches provides a mechanism to balance the loads over the corresponding core switches, by slightly increasing the transmission cost of the external traffic B. The Placement Problem A major task of our work is to make the DCN scalable by distributing the component sets to different nodes. Accordingly a scalability related cost is defined to increase with the size of the component sets. Distributed placement reduces this cost but leads to additional delay and transmission cost for the DCN internal traffic \(defined as the DCN internal overhead Such a tradeoff is further complicated by the external demands and internal traffic patterns of the DCN, which require the switches and racks to be clustered into proper component sets and be placed at suitable nodes More specifically, it is desirable to find a set of nodes in vicinity to each other for component set placement, such that the transmission cost and delay of the DCN internal traffic can be minimized while bulky component sets can be avoided. On the other hand, demands at individual nodes need to be served with small transmission cost for external traffic, which translates to a more distributed placement of service interfaces and component sets. For a specific DCN service, the worst-case internal traffic pattern among the racks is relatively stable. It can be estimated and planned at the network planning stage Based on the internal traffic pattern, it is desirable to put those racks with heavy inter-rack traffic into the same component set placed at a single node, such that data switching among them can be locally handled without incurring additional long-haul     Optical fibers and wavelengths  205 Optical network Internet  Rack DCN clients ToR Switch Optical core switch Content switch  Fig.1.

 transmission cost. As a result, each component set tends to be large, but this contradicts the scalability. Moreover, component placement is constrained by the specific network topology as well. Other than properly clustering the racks, we still need to find a suitable set of nodes in the network and match each of them with one or several component sets for placement. All the above conflicting factors \(external and internal traffic, rack clustering and node mapping, and scalability\re coupled together, leading to a very complex yet interesting cost minimization problem Given a set of DCN service demands at the nodes in a network and the service-oriented internal traffic pattern among the racks of a DCN, we need to solve the following set of coupled sub-problems with the objective of minimizing the overall system cost by taking the scalability related cost and the DCN internal overhead into account: 1\ determine the number of content and core switches required; 2\ cluster the switches and racks into proper component sets; 3\ place the component sets at suitable nodes in the network; 4\ find the service request and delivery routes from the demanding nodes to the DCN service interfaces \(i.e., the content switches\; 5\ figure out the switching and routing scheme for the DCN internal traffic; and 6\ achieve load balancing among the core switches III  ILP  F ORMULATION  To quantify the increasing cost for bulky component sets we assume that the basic cost of investment of a component set at a particular warehouse is characterized by the scalability related cost function in Fig. 2. If the number of server racks in the component set exceeds a specific limit \(e.g   in Fig. 2\he basic cost \(e.g., system cooling, power supply and warehouse rent, etc.\ will step up accordingly. For simplicity we also let the scalability related cost include the costs of ToR and aggregation switches as well as optical interconnects inside the component set, since they are generally proportional to the number of racks in the component set as well Based on notations in Section III.A, we formulate the optimal ILP \(Integer Linear Program\ in Section III.B. It minimizes the overall system cost for deploying a DCN in a given optical network under a set of predefined external demands and DCN internal traffic. By translating the long-haul transmission delay of the DCN internal traffic into a cost factor comparable to others, the ILP takes into account the DCN internal overhead and the scalability related cost as in Fig. 2 A.

 the corresponding basic cost can be properly calculated in the second term of \(1\. Constraint \(7\ specifies that the total amount of all inter-node DCN internal traffic equals to that switched by all core switches, where is formulated in \(3\. Constraint \(8 limits the sum load of external and internal traffic at a core switch to its maximum switching capacity. Constraint \(9 formulates the flow conservation property of the external demands. Finally, constraints \(10\-\(11\ check whether a pair of content and core switches is collocated with any racks at a particular node u which provides to count the last term in \(1 IV  N UMERICAL R ESULTS  Simulations are carried out based on the US network with 14 nodes and 21 links, as shown in Fig. 3a. We consider 9 server racks in the DCN, with internal traffic load between an arbitrary pair of server racks defined in Fig. 3b. External demands on the DCN service and per-unit-traffic transmission cost at each link are defined in Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d, respectively Fig. 3e gives simulation parameters, including those for the scalability related cost function The ILP based optimal solution is shown in Fig. 3a. Racks are divided into 5 component sets and are placed at nodes 7, 8 10, 12 and 13. There is a core switch at each of these nodes Note that the number of required core switches is determined by the optimization based on the given DCN internal traffic pattern and external demands, instead of being predefined Fig. 4c lists the routes of external demands in the optimal ILP solution, where the number above each arrow indicates the traffic load on the corresponding link or switched locally at the same node \(e.g e can see that most of the demands are served by their closest core switches. Nevertheless, the 7 units of demands at node 2 are split into 5+2 and are served by core switches at nodes 7 and 13, respectively. This is because the core switch at node 7 runs out of its switching capacity, and thus two units of demand at node 2 must take a slightly longer route to be served by the core switch placed at node 13. In fact this shows that the proposed architecture provides a mechanism for balancing traffic loads among the core switches via external demands routing in the optical network Fig. 4f shows how the inter-node internal traffics are routed and switched. Internal traffics between two component sets are generally switched by one or both of the two core switches collocated with the component sets. However, 5 units of the internal traffic between nodes 7 and 12 are served by the core switches at node 10, because the switches at nodes 7 and 12 have no spare capacity to switch this 5 units of internal traffic V  C ONCLUSION  We proposed a scalable Data Center Network \(DCN architecture by using optical switches and interconnect with distributed placement of switches and racks across a given optical network. This solves the critical concern on scalability of DCNs, but leads to additional internal overhead due to delay and transmission costs of the DCN internal traffic. By leveraging among multiple conflicting factors and taking sufficient care of the DCN internal overhead, we formulated the cost minimization problem to reduce the overall system cost of deploying a DCN in a distributed manner. An ILP \(Integer Linear Program\ was proposed to place the DCN component sets under a given set of external demands and internal traffic pattern. Simulation experiments validate the correctness of the ILP and the proposed architecture.

If the picture of the area is took by a panoramic camera, much more useful information of the area can be obtained. For ex ample, Figure 10 shows the picture of the same place, which was took by a wide range camera. We can know that there was a large ship near the house by the figure x. The ship was not seen by the Figure 9. As the same way, 360 degree panoramic picture of the same place may have much more information.

Special Interesting Group on University and College Computing Service of Association for Computing Machinery \(ACM SIGUCCS\is an association of professionals who support and manage the diverse aspects of information technology services at higher education institutions SIGI OT i s a s i m ilar g r ou p to th e  SIGUCCS in Japan. There were also a symposium and presentations on disaster recovery in conferences of SIGUCCS such like  8 9   Participants of this workshop received various real data during one week after the earthquake. They re-analyzed the data, discussed what they can do for the disaster in a future and developed services. These services were reported at the end of the workshop Som e pict u r es of t h e sect ion 4 were made in this workshop by one of the authors  Hack for Japan is a community for realizing the will of IT developers, çTo make good use of the communityês develop skills to the Great East Japan Earthquake Th e  community is acting for support disaster recovery and preparing for the disaster in a future by IT development The communityês another mission is propagate the hacker mind through the activity iSPP[15 is a g r ou p to bu ild and operate an in f o r m a tion platform by utilizing their professional knowledge, skills expertise and resources. The group will focus on activities to help mitigate the burden of the devastated people. In parallel, they will engage in surveying and recording the destruction and damages, as well as researching how people sought for information during the catastrophe and aftermath Tasukeai Japa is a g r o u p f o r prov iding precise  information and needs to the damaged area and rescue corpuses. This group is co-operating with government offices  In order to provide a forum for exchanging ideas by the groups such like the above, IT 000 Disaster meeting was held   VI C ONCLUDING REMARKS  In order to realize resilient society, in order to cope with the next disaster which may happen in a future, we are recording what we did in terms of administrator of ICT infrastructure. And we are struggling to find ways to recover from the disaster. We have found that tools and ways which were not used daily did not help disaster recovery. We are also finding the way to cope with disaster using tools and ways of daily life R EFERENCES  1

detail panel In the detail panel all the context and video clips related to the keyphrase are retrieved the user can conveniently explore comparing and analyze them  Collaborative Annotation and Feedback  When analyzing the context of visual entity or node users might come up with new thoughts or ideas As such we also build a channel for them to provide their new knowledge and feedback Firstly as shown in Figure 4 a node or visual entity can be annotated In addition to annotating users can also alert the existing the notes on the map They can choose to generate new nodes and drag them on the proper position on the keyphrase map Within a online community such usergenerated content will be shared and edited among different Stories Matter users which enables a novel human-centric collaborative data processing manner Using this human-centric collaborative design people can conveniently and interactively share each otherês analysis process which answers the question Q4  CKM is a systematic integration of text mining and information visualization and designed to signiìcantly improve the functionalities and user experience of original Stories Matter Such visual analytic tool could be further reìned and enhanced in a number of interesting ways and also be scaled up for more general usage Also its effectiveness and efìciency need be evaluated in eld tests V F UTURE P LAN Our next step is to invite ve to ten researchers who use Stories Matter database to use our prototype for a period of Figure 4 Highlighting and navigating to the context and associated video clip of keyphrase Budapest time say two months During this period we will observe several sessions when the researchers use the prototype to help us understand the effectiveness and efìciency of the tool in use context We will also interview the researchers to collect their feedback on the usability of the prototype and suggestions on the future design In our previous design tags and keyphrases are considered on the same semantic level In fact a tag typically represents a topic and thus should be more general than keyphrases Their difference in generality should be better considered and organized In addition to keyphrase extraction we plan to use the topic modelling technologies to automatically extract the topics and their words distribution in a document We will then create a hierarchy that each visual entity will have multiple topics and each topic will be associated with numbers of keyphrases Once the topic hierarchies have been built a intelligent scaling strategy just like Google Map will be applied At the top level users only see the visual entities and their topics When zoom in more and more detailed keyphrase will be rendered accordingly If the number of visual entities on the clock is large a hyperbolic-view can be utilized to dynamically visualize the complex hierarchical structure At last the clock-based keyphrase map is not restricted for the Stories Matter system We believe that any type of projects generating time-series textual dataset could beneìt from this visual analytic tool For example suppose in an online collaborative project each team member will generate numbers of Email SMS documents meeting records etc These textual data could be summarized and visualized by our tool to facilitate the data processing tasks as well as team communication VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we present a visual analytical tool that facilitates the qualitative analysis of collections of audio/video interview recordings about human rights Taking a participatory design approach weve been working closely with the human rights researchers in the requirement analysis iterative design and evaluation process The current prototype combines combines Keyphrase text-mining and Clockbased visualization techniques and we plan to conduct an evaluation study of the prototype as well as exploring other text mining techniques such as topic modeling Developed based on Stories Matter a database developed and shared by a community of oral history researchers our tool represents a signiìcant step in the long-term development of the database as an interpretative and search tool for humanities and social science researchers working with qualitative interview data The original database was developed to better analyse oral narratives and to follow threads of signiìcance across interviews As a result it was an example of little data researchers scaling up With this new visualization tool we see big data researchers applying some of the 111 


insights and techniques of data-mining and visualization on a qualitative research tool that operates at multiple scales from the narrative analysis of a single interview to large datasets of thousands of hours of audio or video recorded interviews This visualization tool has the great potential to enhance the capacity of the researcher to make-sense of these wider patterns and connections Human rights researchers analyze the relevant data of various sorts format e.g textual audio and video and conduct both qualitative and quantitative content analysis With the increasingly available data sets about human rights violation and their growing sizes navigating and analyzing such large scale data collections is more and more challenging Our work presents a concept of proof of combining text mining and information visualization techniques to address this challenge We anticipate the growing importance of such visual analytic tools that help users conveniently navigate to their on-demanded information and manipulate data and that facilitate users to analyze the large scale data collection through multiple views and interactive features There is no similar tool in use within the eld of oral history With our speciìc CKM design we expect that it is applicable to different kinds of time-series sequential data stream A CKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Kim Moore and Eve-Lyne Cayouette Ashby who participated in the rst design presentation meeting as regular users and maintainers of Stories Matter database They provided valuable feedback on our design ideas This project is funded by SSHRC Digging into Data challenge grant R EFERENCES  D bo yd and K Cra wford Six pro v ocations for big data  i n A Decade in Internet Time Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society  2011  D Fisher  R  Deline M Czerwinski and S Druck er  Inter actions with big data analytics vol 19 no 3 pp 50Ö59 2012  D Rotman Y  He J Preece and A Druin Understanding large scale online environments with qualitative methods in 2013 iConference  2013  T  He y  S T ansle y  and K T olle The Fourth Paradigm DataIntensive Scientiìc Discovery  Microsoft Research 2009  J Heer and S Kandel Interacti v e analysis of big data  vol 19 no 1 pp 50Ö54 2012  S Kandel A P a epck e J Hellerstein and J Heer  Enterprise data analysis and visualization An interview study vol 18 no 12 pp 2917Ö2926 2012  S Knudsen M R Jak obsen and K HornbÊk  A n e xploratory study of how abundant display space may support data analysis in the 7th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction Making Sense Through Design  2012  J Li vnat and Y  Zhang Information interpretation or infor mation discovery Which role of analysts do investors value more vol 13 no 3 pp 612Ö641 2012  A Sri v asta v a and M Sahami Text Mining Classiìcation Clustering and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2009  I H W itten G W  P aynter  E  Frank C Gutwin and C G Nevill-Manning Kea Practical automatic keyphrase extraction in The 4th ACM Conference On Digital Libraries  1999  C Zhang  Automatic k e yw ord e xtraction from documents using conditional random elds vol 4 no 3 pp 1169 1180 2008  Y  nung Chen Y  Huang H yi Lee and L shan Lee Unsupervised two-stage keyword extraction from spoken documents by topic coherence and support vector machine in The 37th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing  2012  H.-L Ong A.-H T an J N Lee H P an and Q.-X Li Foci  Flexible organizer for competitive intelligence in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management  2001  C Jacquemin H F olch and S Nugier  Ocean 2 1/2d interactive visual data mining of text documents in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization  2006  C H K u  J  H  Nguyen and G Lero y  T asc crime report visualization for investigative analysis A case study in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration  2012  W  Cui S Liu L T an C Shi Y  Song Z Gao X T ong and H Qu Textîow towards better understanding of evolving topics in text vol 17 no 21 2001  H Greenspan On Listening to Holocaust Survivors Recounting and Life History  Westport Praeger 2010  M Frisch Three dimensions and more Oral history be yond the paradoxes of method pp 221Ö222 2008  S High M Jessica and S Zembrzycki T elling our stories/animating our past A status report on oral history and new media vol 37 no 3 pp 1Ö22 2012  S High and D Sw orn  After the intervie w The interpreti v e challenges of oral history video indexing vol 1 no 2 2009  K Schaf fer and S Smith Human Rights and Narrated Lives:The Ethics of Recognition  New York and Basingstoke Palgrave Macmillan 2004  E Jessee S Zembrzycki and S High Stories matter Conceptual challenges in the development of oral history database building software vol 12 no 1 2010  L G Shapiro and G C Stockman Computer Vision  Prentice Hall 2001 112
