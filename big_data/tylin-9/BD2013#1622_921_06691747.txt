We introduce in this paper a scalable implementation of Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization method for collaborative ltering using the MapReduce framework Variational Bayesian methods have the advantage of providing good approximate analytical solutions for the posterior distribution Due to the independence assumption about the parameters in the posterior distribution variational methods are also likely to be able to parallelize efìciently Though Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization method has shown to produce more accurate results in collaborative ltering its scaling properties have not studied so far We ran our MapReduce implementation on the CiteULike data set and show that our parallelization scheme achieves approximately linear scaling We also compare its performance with the MapReduce implementation of a popular matrix factorization algorithm ALSWR from the open source machine learning library Mahout Index Terms Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization Probabilistic Matrix Factorization MapReduce Distributed Computing Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems I I NTRODUCTION Matrix factorization is a very popular technique used for Collaborative Filtering to generate personalized recommendations in Ecommerce Its basic idea is to approximate the user-item transaction matrix X as a product of two low-rank matrices U and V X  UV T 1 If the X matrix has dimensions M  N then U and V will have dimensions M  K and N  K respectively Here K<<M,N represents a set of hidden features characterizing the factors that drive consumer preferences In E-commerce scenarios such as major online retailers typically M and N would be of the order of Millions Also the matrix X would be highly sparse with only less than 10 lled by known values This makes the above matrix factorization task highly non-trivial from the point of view of both computation time due to scale and accuracy due to over tting In the last decade several machine learning methods have been developed for improving the accuracy of sparse matrix factorization Well known examples are Weighted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization WNMF Alternate Least Square with W eighted Re gular ization ALSWR and V ariational Bayesian Matrix F actorization VBMF to name a f e w  Hernndez-Lobato and Ghahramani ha v e shown that VBMF compared to other matrix factorization techniques is more robust to over tting and generates more accurate predictions at the long tail in E-Commerce VBMF can also be used as a building block in most complex probabilistic models Though the variational Bayesian methods have been used in many contexts use of variational approximation for scaling the machine learning models for modern day massive data sets have not been studied in detail Nallapati et al have studied the speed and scalability of parallelized variational EM for LDA Zhai et al have implemented variational inference based LDA model using MapReduce In this paper the authors argue that variational methods are very exible for MapReduce type of parallelization because under variational approximation the posterior distribution factorizes and hence one can compute the sufìcient statistics for different parameters independently To our knowledge there are no work reported on the MapReduce parallelization of VBMF Implementation of VBMF using MapReduce parallelization scheme will make it useful for applying in commercial scenarios and also in understanding the scalability of variational machine learning methods in general In this paper we describe the MapReduce implementation of Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization method which is our original contribution We apply our implementation on the CiteULike data set to study the scaling properties We also compare its performance with the MapReduce implementation of ALSWR in the open source machine learning library Mahout 1  Rest of the paper is organized as follows In section II we will describe very brieîy the VBMF method Details of MapReduce implementation is given in section III In section IV we describe the details of Hadoop infrastructure used for this study and approaches used for tuning the performance In section V we present the results on the use of our MapReduce implementation of VBMF on CiteULike data set Summary and conclusions from this work are presented in section VI II V ARIATIONAL B AYESIAN P ROBABILISTIC M ATRIX F ACTORIZATION Variational approximation is a relatively new approach to estimate the posterior distribution in a Bayesian inference problem  Here the idea is to propose an approximate posterior distribution which has a factorized form and is parameterized by a set of variational parameters One then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the variational distribution and the target posterior by using the variational parameters to arrive at a good approximate solution for the posterior distribution Raiko et al  were the rst to use variational method for matrix factorization type of problems Here we describe their method brieîy for more details readers may read the paper of Raiko et al We asume the following likelihood function

TABLE III C OMPARISON OF SCALING OF A VERAGE T IME P ER I TERATION BETWEEN VBMF AND ALSWR  Algorithm Number of Average Time per Nodes Iteration Sec 2 775.3 VBMF 4 600.6 6 475.1 8 401.5 10 348.1 2 123.5 4 123.1 ALSWR 6 124.0 8 123.1 10 119.7 Fig 6 Average Time Per Iteration Vs Number of Nodes cluster One can see that there is an approximate linear decrease in the time per iteration for VBMF A perfect linear scaling is absent perhaps because time taken for data shufîing between nodes is very signiìcant in our computations As the number of nodes increases this becomes more signiìcant and therefore can cause deviation from linear scaling In the case of ALSWR average time per iteration follows almost a at curve instead of a linear trend And the average time per iteration is much lower for ALSWR compared to VBMF Absence of linear scaling seen in ALSWR is quite surprising Since ALSWR is not a probabilistic algorithm it uses only two matrices U and V in the iteration process In VBMF we are considering multiple matrices six in number and due to that the number of jobs are more Most of the jobs except related to cost are independent and use data from previous iteration resulting in the approximate linear scaling In ALSWR for each iteration there are only two matrices to be solved  U and V  The computation of those matrices are dependent on each other Due to this only one job is running at a time In our experiments with ALSWR we found that there are relatively less MapReduce job tasks two-three in each iteration As a result the scaling factor is considerably limited However we need to carry out studies with larger data sets to conìrm this VI C ONCLUSION AND S UMMARY In this work we introduced the parallelization of Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization method using the MapReduce framework Compared to other matrix factorization methods presence of several different variational parameters makes this problem more difìcult However the inherent factorization of variational parameters helps in parallelizing the update equations using MapReduce We evaluated the performance of MapReduce implementation on CiteULike dataset and found near linear scaling We also compared the scaling performance to that of ALSWR algorithm in Mahout machine learning library Surprisingly we did not nd a linear scaling for ALSWR We need to study both the algorithms on much bigger data sets to really explain the observed difference in the scaling behavior This will be undertaken in future To understand the scalability of Variational Bayesian methods in general we are also planning to study the MapReduce parallelization of other machine learning algorithms using the variational approximation A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank our collaborators Prof Zoubin
