Context-Aware Graph Modeling for Object Search and Retrieval in a Wide Area Camera Network Santhoshkumar Sunderrajan Jiejun Xu B.S Manjunath Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering HRL Laboratories University of California Santa Barbara f santhosh,manj g ece.ucsb.edu jxu@hrl.com Abstract 227This paper addresses the problem of context-aware object search and retrieval in a wide area distributed camera network With the proliferation of smart cameras in urban networks it is a challenge to process this big data in an ef\002cient manner A novel graph based model is proposed to 
represent relationships and for search and retrieval tasks This representation exploits the fact that objects occurring in close spatial-temporal proximity are not completely independent and serve as context for each other Additional information such as appearance and scene context can also be encoded into the graph model to improve the overall accuracy A manifold ranking strategy is used to order the items based on similarity with an emphasis on diversity Extensive experimental results on a ten camera network are presented Keywords 227 Context-aware camera networks Graph based ranking Object search and Retrieval 
I I NTRODUCTION The advent of cheap and network enabled cameras has given opportunities for large scale deployment of smart cameras in real world applications However most of these applications are limited in capability due to processing power of cameras and/or network bandwidth constraints In a wide area network for surveillance it is expensive and inef\002cient to send every video frame captured at individual nodes to the central node At the same time a human analyst at the base station would require video frames or information in realtime to take necessary actions during crisis In this paper we 
propose a novel de-centralized graph based approach to query and retrieve objects of interest without necessitating large data 003ow to the central node Consider a 002xed camera network deployed over a wide area see Figure 8 We assume that each of the individual cameras has suf\002cient storage and computational capacity to store and perform basic video analysis such as object detection and tracking We consider the following two scenarios introduced by 1 Spatial-Temporal Browsing see Figure 1\(a A user initiates a spatial-temporal browsing query by marking a region on the image plane and speci\002es a time interval for querying 
An example query would be 223Find object occurrences related to region A speci\002ed by a bounding box from camera 1 between time 9:32am and 9:34am\224 2 Object Searching see Figure 1\(b Given the set of records objects from the browsing query the user could select an object of interest and query the system to identify Fig 1 Sample System Queries a Spatial region along with the timeinterval is speci\002ed as an initial query to the system b Object of interest is marked by a green bounding box 
the same or related objects possessing similar spatial-temporal and appearance information For example 223Find all objects related to the selected object at region C from camera 1 at time 9:33:01am\224 This problem is closely related to object reidenti\002cation To accomplish the above-mentioned goals most of the existing methodologies assume that global trajectories of targets are available 10 12 W ith the e xisting state of the art object detectors and trackers 14 a v ailability of accurate global trajectories is not a reasonable assumption Using appearance based features alone it is a challenging task to re-identify objects in multiple views due to changes in 
viewpoint angle illumination and background clutter Hence additional spatial-temporal constraints along with contextual information are needed for re-identifying objects Towards achieving the above objectives we propose a distributed surveillance system that globally models the entire network using a context-aware graph and enables users to 002nd a set of 223representative\224 and 223diverse\224 snapshots to understand the network events Objects are detected and tracked in individual camera frames At every frame each of the individual cameras sends an abstracted record comprising of spatial temporal and visual appearance information about an object to the central node At the central node we break long 
object tracks into several smaller tracklets Tracklet serves as a basic atomic unit for our analysis The central node builds a context based time-evolving graph of the network using these tracklets Most importantly we propose a strategy to encode contextual information such as appearance spatialtemporal and scene contexts Also past historical data is used to model the spatial-temporal transition between two camera views Finally we use an off-the-shelf graph ranking algorithm to 002nd relevant records based on the user query Following are the main contributions of this work 


1 A robust context-aware network graph modeling and extensive experimentation on a large scale camera network 2 A novel non-parametric spatial-temporal network topology modeling  The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II describes related works on context based object re-identi\002cation and a graph-based method for visual searching Section III describes the proposed methodology in detail Section IV illustrates context based modeling of the network Section V highlights the manner in which the spatial-temporal modeling of the network is performed Section VI describes graph based ranking methodology for retrieving objects Finally Section VII presents experimental results from a real 10camera outdoor network and Section VIII concludes this paper II R ELATED W ORK The proposed system is closely related to the problem of object re-identi\002cation or reacquisition There have been several distributed camera systems that collect observ ations from remote cameras and assign a unique global object ID based on appearance and/or spatial information Most of the appearance based object re-identi\002cation methods operate by 002nding the best matching criterion For example w orks by jointly modeling motion and appearance while learns a low-dimensional subspace of brightness transfer functions for matching In authors propose a pca-sift based v ocab ulary tree for re-identifying objects in a camera network setup Interestingly all these methods operate by comparing observations from different views in a pair wise manner proposes an approach to model the network graph using appearance and spatial temporal features However appearance based observation modeling does not take context into account and it suffers from viewpoint changes Oliva et al demonstrate that conte xt plays a signi\002cant role in the human visual system Ali et al proposed a tracking system that uses motion and appearance context of co-occurring objects to improve the tracking accuracy Zhu et al proposed a conte xt-a w are acti vity recognition and anomaly detection system leveraging spatial-temporal and scene contexts This paper extends our earlier work where we 002rst introduced contextual links into a graph model We propose a graph based methodology to represent relationships among camera observations Contextual information such as appearance spatial and scene are used to weight the graph edges Graph based modeling provides an ef\002cient tool for combining information from multiple sources Tong et al provide an ef\002cient strategy to fuse information from multiple sources such as image level features and text based annotations Similar to 20 we pose the problem of user interaction as a uni\002ed ranking problem for identifying representative and diverse snapshots that match the user query III P ROPOSED M ETHOD Consider a network of C distributed static cameras with embedded storage and computing power It is assumed that each camera node can detect and track objects in its 002eld of view and send the appearance and other relevant object information to a central node The central node builds a dynamic graph as it receives information from camera nodes The time-evolving graph models spatial and temporal relationship between different cameras that can then be used to answer queries such as 223Find observations related to region A of camera 1 between time t 1 and t 2 224  the central node performs a ranking based on the time-evolving graph built at that time instance and requests candidate frames for visualization In this way no raw image or video data is sent back and forth over the network and also the system operates within the network bandwidth constraints A Real-time Distributed Detection and Tracking At each camera node moving objects are detected using connected component analysis based on the foreground pixels obtained using a background subtraction technique These foreground blobs are individually tracked using a mean-shift based object tracker A unique obj ect ID is assigned to each of the tracked objects For each frame an individual camera generates a record for the detected/tracked object and sends it to the central node over the network Each record is represented using the following information camera ID time object's bounding box on the image plane a 64-bin normalized hue histogram as appearance representation object type speed and direction of motion B Graph Based Modeling of a Camera Network At time instance 223t\224 let N be the total number of detected/tracked objects in the entire camera network and more objects could be added as they are detected/tracked We propose a graph based framework wherein we construct a network graph G   V E  of the tracked objects The nodes v i 2 V 1 024 i 024 N are the set of tracklets extracted from the entire network We assumed that long-term tracking is not possible due to various reasons appearance changes illumination effects and hence we break object trajectories into many shorter temporal windows of size F  4 frames The edges e ij 2 E represent connections between the nodes The edge weights W i;j are computed by taking contextual and spatial-temporal topology information of the network into account At 002rst the proposed methodology is developed with a snapshot of the graph at time t  more nodes can be added to this time evolving graph in a trivial manner If two nodes v i and v j are from the same camera and belong to the same object we set W ij  024  where 024 is a constant in our experiments we set 024  1  If the nodes belong to tracklets from two different cameras context-aware observation and spatial-temporal topology information are used to compute the weights W i;j  W Observation i;j  021W T opology i;j 1 IV C

Fig 2 Appearance Context An object of interest is marked with a green bounding box Color histogram is computed for every object in the scene and a feature difference matrix is computed with respect to the object of interest A Appearance Context Appearance context models the inter-object appearance variations Object association is computed in a robust manner by using the knowledge of appearance variations with respect to other co-occurring objects in the scene when the appearance cues are weak and inconsistent between two different views Let O  f O i g M i 1 be the set of tracklets in the 002rst camera view and M be the number of objects Let each tracklet be represented by a D  64 dimensional normalized hue histogram H i   h 1    h D  T  At a given time t  we compute the feature difference matrix 003 i for a tracklet O i with respect to other tracklets f O j g j 6  i in a given view 003 i   j H i 000 H 1 j       j H i 000 H j j  3 This matrix 003 i captures the inter-object appearance variations similar to W e assume that the dif ference matrix follows Gaussian distribution and estimate the mean  026 i  and the covariance  006 i  using standard techniques In the neighboring camera view let O 0  f O 0 i g M 0 i 0 1 be the set of observed tracklets and M 0 is the number of tracklets We 002nd the feature difference matrix 003 0 i 0 and the corresponding Gaussian distribution parameters  026 i 0 and 006 i 0  Figure 2 demonstrates the appearance context We assume that the objects in different views have a similar feature difference distribution and the appearance based weighting is given by W Appearance i;i 0  1 2  D X d 1 q H i  d  H i 0  d   036 003 i  003 0 i 0   4 where 036 003 i  003 0 i 0  is the multi-variate Bhattacharya distance between the two feature difference distributions in two different views and it is given by 036 003 i  003 0 i 0   1 8  026 i 000 026 i 0  T 006 000 1  026 i 000 026 i 0  1 2 ln  det\(\006 p det\(\006 i  det\(\006 i 0   5 where 006  006 i 006 i 0  2  B Spatial-Temporal Context Spatial context refers to the spatial inter-relationship between co-occurring objects There exist other co-occurring Fig 3 Spatial-Temporal Context An object of interest is marked with a green bounding box and a co-occurring object is marked with a red bounding box a Object of interest moves towards the co-occurring object b Object of interest moves along with the co-occurring object c Object of interest moves away from the co-occurring object objects in the scene that exhibit strong motion correlation with the object of interest Relative con\002gurations between these sets of observed objects in the given view can serve as a strong cue for association between two neighboring camera views Similarly the temporal context captures relative changes in two tracklets with respect to time Two or more objects maintaining a constant distance between each other or converging towards each other or diverging away from each other are some of the examples of spatial-temporal context 1 Spatial-Temporal Context based graph model Given the set of tracklets O  f O i g M i 1  let F be the temporal size of the tracklets in our experiments we set F  4 frames we compute the pair-wise Euclidean distance d  f  ij between the tracklets at time t where j 6  i  We use three bins to represent spatial-temporal context at frame f i.e stc ij  f   h I  d  f  ij  d  f 000 1 ij   I  d  f  ij  d  f 000 1 ij   I  d  f  ij  d  f 000 1 ij  i where I is an indicator function The spatialtemporal context between two tracklets is given by ST C ij  1  F 000 1 P F f 2 stc ij  f   The overall spatial context for the tracklet O i with respect to other tracklets in the scene is given by t i  1  M 000 1 X j ST C ij 6 Figure 3 illustrates spatial-temporal context Note that the elements of unnormalized t i sum up to the number of cooccurring tracklets and each bin speci\002es the number of tracklets having certain spatial-temporal behavior with respect to the tracklet of interest We compute a similar spatial context vector t 0 i 0 for tracklets in the neighboring views with respect to the tracklet O i 0  Thus W Spatial 000 T emporal i;i 0  1 000 emd t i  t 0 i 0  7 where emd is the Earth mover's distance The spatial context based weighting has a tendency to give a strong con\002dence value if the same set of objects behave similarly in neighboring views This might not be true in case of the camera views that are geographically far apart and objects might disappear and new objects might appear in the long run Also spatial-temporal context is more relevant when

various retrieval depths 026 signi\002es relative contribution of neighbors and initial ranking scores to the 002nal ranking scores By emphasizing diversity change in parameter 026 had little effect on the overall precision D Discussion on Graph Size At the central node we build a time-evolving graph using the tracklets received from different camera views and it has a tendency to in\003ate over the time In our experiments the network graph consisted of 7125 nodes with 44196344 edges approximately 87 connectivity compared to a complete graph For memory optimization we can ignore nodes that were added before a certain period of time say 2 hours Also we can neglect the connectivity between the nodes from distant camera views VIII C ONCLUSION This paper proposes a novel context-aware graph based system to assist human analysts to ef\002ciently browse and search objects in a large wide area camera network We provide a novel strategy to encode contextual information such as appearance scene and spatial-temporal contexts to increase the overall accuracy of retrieval The proposed methodology is validated with extensive experiments on some real-world large scale camera network dataset With contextual information the accuracy of the proposed system is increased by approximately 50  in terms of F-measure A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by ONR grant N00014-12-10503 R

from existing ontologies, the focus of our work is to build a holistic SLA ontology for services evaluation. Therefore the QoS model to be used should be tailored to the specific aspects of service life cycle In that respect, the QoS model could be based on existing works in the field of cloud computing that focused on the development of cloud service evaluation m i n e a set of criteria upon which the comparison of different services can be done. These works are complementary to ours since they provide a reference model to build the QoS ontology that includes a set of evaluation criteria for cloud service comparison. Finally, relevant to our work are also approaches that tackle the problem of cloud service evaluation and selection 14   T h es e approach es ap ply t y pical l y  decision making methods to decide on the optimal service with respect to the requirements. Most of these works have focused on the evaluation of quantitative selection criteria limiting thus their scope only to those criteria that can be directly measured. Recently it has been proposed in a  fuzzy-based approach for the consideration of both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Our work is also complementary to these efforts since our goal is to provide a theoretical basis and a common vocabulary upon which this decision making process can be applied. In particular, since the evaluation of qualitative metrics is a hard task, in this paper we have argued that the use of a service reputation mechanism that spans over the different selection criteria can be assistive in an effort to evaluate and integrate qualitative metrics during the service selection VI D ISCUSSION AND F UTURE W ORKS  In this paper, we have motivated the need for a holistic model which connects all the lifecycle steps based on a common QoS ontology. To this end, we have presented an SLA ontology that introduces key concepts, such as Service, QoS Requirements, Role, Actor and Feedback which are tightly connected with SLA. Our ontology distinguishes between objective feedback coming from software monitoring and subjective feedback coming from the evaluation of users. We propose a symmetric handling of these two kinds of feedback and we demonstrate through a simple example, how objective and subjective feedback could provide input to a cloud service selection method. Furthermore, the ontology allows the profiling of users to enable the filtering of feedback according to their source Currently we assume that users feedback are expressed as numeric values in Lickert scale, and the aggregated feedback could be calculated as an average value. This aggregated value could be used as input to existing cloud selection methods [8   Bes ides  in f u t u re w o rk w e w a n t  to u s e th e S LA on tol ogy  in order to enrich our ontology and build a more sophisticated reputation mechanism that co nsiders the reliability of the feedback and its source, as well as reputation of other actors of the ecosystem. Furthermore, we want to explore other possible applications of our ontology, including SLA establishment negotiation, service adaptation and selection A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research presented in this paper is supported by the European Union within the FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network çRELATEé and the FP7 B IBLIOGRAPHY  1
